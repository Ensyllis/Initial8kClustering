19,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2009. As part of its ongoing evaluation of our general and executive compensation programs, the Executive Compensation and Human Resource Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our existing compensation plans and arrangements and recommended to our Board certain modified compensation plans and arrangements for 2010 to better align short- and long-term incentives with increasing stockholder value. On October 27, 2009, our Board approved these changes as more fully described below. 1. 2010 Performance Incentive Plan (the ""2010 PIP"") As part of our overall compensation program, our Performance Incentive Plans provide an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel, including those officers designated as Named Executive Officers in our 2009 Proxy Statement, based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. In connection with the increased annual focus to our compensation program, performance goals are set and measured annually, as opposed to our former practice of setting performance goals annually and measuring goals quarterly and annually. The financial measures and relative weightings under the 2010 PIP, like the 2009 PIP, differ for corporate employees and business unit and international employees. For corporate employees, the 2010 PIP financial measures and weights remain unchanged and include full year adjusted Earnings Per Share, Net Sales, and Free Cash Flow. For business unit and international employees, the performance metrics now include localized Net Sales, Operating Income and certain cash flow metrics to better align performance targets with measurable results at the business unit, country and region levels. Executive officers leading business units or regions will continue to be measured against business or regional performance targets. In order to maintain focus on quality objectives, the 2010 PIP also considers corporate-wide performance on quality goals. During the first quarter of 2010, the Compensation Committee will approve actual performance targets for the 2010 performance year for eligible employees under the PIP. Payments to executive officers under the 2010 PIP are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation that is deductible under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. For section 162(m) purposes, funding will be based on attainment of financial goals, and individual and quality goals will be taken into account through the exercise of negative discretion. 2. 2010 Performance Share Plan Beginning in 2010, performance share awards in the form of Deferred Stock Units will be granted to executive officers and certain other members of our senior management team in order to place additional emphasis on creating long-term stockholder value. The performance shares granted under our 2010 Performance Share Plan will be one equity vehicle within the overall mix of our long-term incentive program and will be awarded under our 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan which was previously approved by stockholders. Under the Performance Share Plan, performance will be measured in three annual performance cycles comparing our own Total Shareholder Return to the Total Shareholder Return of the companies in the S&P 500 Healthcare Industry Index. Under this Plan, Total Shareholder Return will be defined as the change in stock price plus dividends paid over the average closing stock price for the last 60 days of the calendar year prior to the year in which the grant is made. At the end of the three year performance period, final Total Shareholder Return will be calculated using the simple average of the three annual performance cycles. Performance Shares will fully vest after the three year period based on meeting performance requirements approved by the Compensation Committee on the date of grant. 3. Executive Life Insurance Until 2004, we provided our executive officers split dollar life insurance under our executive life insurance program. This program has been closed to new participants since 2004. However, rather than terminating pre-existing insurance policies, we have made annual cash payments to certain current and former executive officers, including Fredericus A. Colen, a Named Executive Officer, in an amount equal to the annual premium of the policy plus a gross-up for tax purposes. On October 27, 2009, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved payments to these current and former executive officers, including Mr. Colen, for the purpose of eliminating this benefit. Each individual with an executive life insurance policy will receive a payment equal to the remaining premiums to be made under the policy discounted at a rate of 4% to net present value. Mr. Colen will receive a cash payment in the amount of approximately $220,000, which amount includes a tax gross-up.

20,DELL,"       Dell Inc. (DELL) filed a Form 8K - Acquisition or Disposition of Assets - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 03, 2009. On November 3, 2009, Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Dell""), completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""Shares""), of Perot Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""Perot Systems""), in accordance with the terms of the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), dated September 20, 2009, as amended, by and among Dell, DII Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Dell (the ""Purchaser""), and Perot Systems. Dell's acquisition of the Shares was structured as a two-step transaction, consisting of a tender offer by the Purchaser for the Shares at a price of $30.00 per Share (the ""Offer Price""), without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding or stock transfer taxes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated October 2, 2009, and in the related Letter of Transmittal, each, as amended and supplemented from time to time, filed by Dell and the Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 2, 2009 (the ""Offer""), followed by the merger of the Purchaser with and into Perot Systems, with Perot Systems surviving as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Dell (the ""Merger""). The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Monday, November 2, 2009. Based upon information provided by BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, the depositary for the Offer, approximately 108,774,629 Shares were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, representing approximately 87.7% of the Shares outstanding as of November 2, 2009. The depositary also informed Dell that it received commitments to tender 3,961,266 additional Shares under the guaranteed delivery procedures for the Offer. On November 3, 2009, the Purchaser accepted for payment all validly tendered and not properly withdrawn Shares (including Shares tendered to the depositary pursuant to the Offer's guaranteed delivery procedures) and will promptly make payment for such Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer and applicable law. On November 3, 2009, Dell issued a press release announcing the successful completion of the Offer, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Following the Purchaser's acceptance for payment of all validly tendered and not properly withdrawn Shares on November 3, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser merged with and into Perot Systems in accordance with the provisions of Delaware law that authorize the completion of the Merger as a ""short form"" merger without a vote or meeting of the stockholders of Perot Systems. In order to complete the Merger as a ""short form"" merger under Delaware law, on November 3, 2009 the Purchaser exercised its ""top-up"" option pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which permitted it to purchase additional Shares directly from Perot Systems for $30.00 per Share, the same price paid in the Offer. In the Merger, each Share not purchased in the Offer (other than shares held in treasury or reserved for issuance by Perot Systems and Shares held by Dell or the Purchaser or direct or indirect subsidiaries of Dell or Perot Systems, all of which were cancelled and extinguished, and Shares held by stockholders who validly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive in cash the Offer Price, without interest thereon and less applicable withholding or stock transfer taxes. Following the Merger, Perot Systems became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Dell. The foregoing summary description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Merger Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement, copies of which are referenced as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Dell's estimated cost to acquire Perot Systems and to pay all related fees and expenses was approximately 4.2 billion.

21,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 04, 2009. On November 4, 2009, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal first quarter 2010 ended October 24, 2009. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. In addition, the transcript of a video of the Registrant's Chief Financial Officer discussing first quarter results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data, non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the period presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, enhanced early retirement benefits, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; for example, effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Registrant no longer excludes payroll tax on stock option exercises, and effective in fiscal 2010 Cisco no longer excludes in-process research and development as it is no longer expensed as a result of new accounting guidance. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expenses, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Enhanced early retirement benefits. The Registrant excluded expenses related to an enhanced early retirement program, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Registrant excludes these expenses because the Registrant does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. During the Registrant's fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling. The decision changes the tax treatment of share-based compensation expenses for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While Cisco was not a named party to the case, the decision resulted in a change in Cisco's tax benefits recognized in its financial statements. The Registrant excluded a related tax charge because it was unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Enhanced early retirement benefit expenses are an unusual occurrence. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

22,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 04, 2009. On November 4, 2009, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 27, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. The Company decided to include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit in pro forma results starting in fiscal 2009 because it recurs with relative frequency and would have been included in the Company's pro forma results for the prior year if it had been reenacted in the prior fiscal year. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, ""pro forma"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.

Today we announced that we have reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice related to product advisories issued by our Guidant subsidiary in 2005. The alleged conduct and product sales occurred prior to our 2006 acquisition of Guidant. We had previously disclosed an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis into alleged violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by Guidant. Under the terms of the agreement, Guidant will plead to two misdemeanor charges related to failure to include information in reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and we will pay $296 million on behalf of Guidant. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require that this agreement be recorded in the third quarter, as it occurred after the October 19, 2009 release of our third quarter financial results and before the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, we have updated our financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, recording a third quarter charge of $294 million, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis. This amount represents the $296 million charge associated with the agreement net of a $2 million reversal of a related accrual. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

29,ORCL,"       Oracle Corp. (ORCL) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 09, 2009. On November 9, 2009, Oracle Corporation received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission relating to its proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. and issued the following statement which is being furnished for purposes of this report (and therefore shall not be treated as ""filed"" or incorporated by reference into any filing): STATEMENT OF ORACLE CORPORATION Oracle's acquisition of Sun is essential for competition in the high end server market, for revitalizing Sparc and Solaris and for strengthening the Java development platform. The transaction does not threaten to reduce competition in the slightest, including in the database market. The Commission's Statement of Objections reveals a profound misunderstanding of both database competition and open source dynamics. It is well understood by those knowledgeable about open source software that because MySQL is open source, it cannot be controlled by anyone. That is the whole point of open source. The database market is intensely competitive with at least eight strong players, including IBM, Microsoft, Sybase and three distinct open source vendors. Oracle and MySQL are very different database products. There is no basis in European law for objecting to a merger of two among eight firms selling differentiated products. Mergers like this occur regularly and have not been prohibited by United States or European regulators in decades. The U.S. Department of Justice carefully reviewed the proposed acquisition during the normal Hart-Scott-Rodino review and considered it again when the European Commission initiated a second phase review. On both occasions the Justice Department came to the conclusion that there is nothing anticompetitive about the deal, including specifically Oracle's acquisition of the MySQL database product. The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition without conditions and terminated the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on August 20, 2009. Sun's customers universally support this merger and do not benefit from the continued uncertainty and delay. Oracle plans to vigorously oppose the Commission's Statement of Objections as the evidence against the Commission's position is overwhelming. Given the lack of any credible theory or evidence of competitive harm, we are confident we will ultimately obtain unconditional clearance of the transaction. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about Oracle and Sun, including statements that involve risks and uncertainties concerning the European Commission's Statement of Objections, clearance of the transaction by the European Commission and satisfaction of other conditions to closing the transaction. When used in this press release, the words ""plans"" and ""will"" and other similar expressions and any other statements that are not historical facts are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. Any such statement may be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Oracle or Sun, that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected, described, expressed or implied in this document due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among others, the possibility that the transaction will not close or that the closing may be further delayed and the possibility that Oracle or Sun may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on the results of operations or financial condition of Oracle or Sun. In addition, please refer to the documents that Oracle and Sun, respectively, file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for additional risks. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Neither Oracle nor Sun is under any duty to update any of the information in this press release.

43,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25, 2009. On October 11, 2008, Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron"") and Micron Semiconductor, B.V. (""MNL""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with Qimonda AG (""Qimonda"") and Qimonda Holding B.V.

(""Inotera"") held by the Sellers (the ""Share Purchase Transactions""). In connection with the second closing of the Share Purchase Transactions, on November 26, 2008, Micron and MNL entered into a loan agreement with Nan Ya Plastics Corporation (""NPC"") pursuant to which NPC made a loan to MNL (the ""NPC Loan"") in the principal amount of $200 million, maturing November 26, 2009 (the ""NPC Loan Agreement""). The proceeds of the NPC Loan were used to pay the purchase price for certain of the shares of common stock of Inotera under the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the NPC Loan Agreement, Micron guaranteed the NPC Loan. The NPC Loan bears interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 2% and is secured by a pledge of the shares of common stock of Inotera held by MNL and by Micron Technology Asia Pacific, Inc. (""MTT""). On November 25, 2009, MNL entered into a loan agreement with Mai Liao Power Corporation, an affiliate of NPC and NTC (""Mai Liao""), in the principal amount of $200 million (the ""Mai Liao Loan"") on essentially the same terms of the NPC Loan (the ""Mai Liao Loan Agreement""), the proceeds of which were used to repay the NPC Loan. The Mai Liao Loan matures on November 24, 2010. Pursuant to the Mai Liao Loan Agreement, Micron guaranteed the Mai Liao Loan. The Mai Liao Loan bears interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 2% and is secured by a pledge of the shares of common stock of Inotera held by MNL and MTT. The Mai Liao Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants including further assurances, compliance with laws, payment of taxes, maintenance of insurance and properties and notice of defaults or events of default. The events of default under the Mai Liao Loan Agreement include the failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts due under the Mai Liao Loan Agreement and related pledge agreement beyond specified grace periods, the failure to perform material obligations or covenants under the Mai Liao Loan Agreement and related pledge agreement beyond a specified grace period, and bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to Micron or MNL.

45,DELL,"       Dell Inc. (DELL) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 03, 2009. (d) On December 3, 2009, Mr. Ross H. Perot, Jr., former Chairman of the Board of Perot Systems Corporation (""Perot Systems""), was appointed to Dell's Board of Directors. Mr. Perot will serve on the Board of Directors until the next annual meeting of stockholders, scheduled for July 16, 2010, at which time his continued service will be subject to renomination and stockholder approval. Mr. Perot served as the Chairman of the Board of Perot Systems from September 2004 until Dell's acquisition of Perot Systems on November 3, 2009. Mr. Perot also served as a director of Perot Systems from June 1988 until November 3, 2009 and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Perot Systems from September 2000 until September 2004. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into among Dell, its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary DII Holdings Inc. (the ""Purchaser"") and Perot Systems on September 20, 2009 (as amended, the ""Merger Agreement""), subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Purchaser commenced a tender offer (the ""Offer"") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Perot Systems (the ""Shares"") at a purchase price of $30.00 per Share in cash, without interest thereon (the ""Offer Price""). Upon successful completion of the Offer, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser merged with and into Perot Systems on November 3, 2009 (the ""Merger""). In the Merger, each Share not purchased in the Offer (other than shares held in treasury or reserved for issuance by Perot Systems and Shares held by Dell or the Purchaser or direct or indirect subsidiaries of Dell or Perot Systems, all of which were cancelled and extinguished, and Shares held by stockholders who validly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive in cash the Offer Price, without interest thereon. Following the Merger, Perot Systems became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell. The Merger Agreement did not contain any provisions with respect to the appointment of Mr. Perot to Dell's Board of Directors or otherwise obligate Dell to take any actions with respect to the proposal, nomination or appointment of Mr. Perot. At a meeting held on July 27, 2009 to discuss the merits of a possible acquisition of Perot Systems, Mr. Michael S. Dell, Dell's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, informed Mr. Perot that he would consider proposing Mr. Perot for a seat on Dell's Board of Directors following the closing of the possible acquisition, subject to the approval of Dell's Governance and Nominating Committee. During the course of further meetings with Mr. Perot in August 2009, Thomas W. Luce, III, a member of Dell's Board of Directors, also advised Mr. Perot that he intended to propose Mr. Perot for a seat on Dell's Board of Directors following the closing of the possible acquisition. At a regular meeting of Dell's Board of Directors on September 15, 2009 at which the Board of Directors discussed the possible acquisition of Perot Systems, the Board of Directors also discussed the possible director nomination of Mr. Perot. Mr. Dell stated that he would likely propose Mr. Perot as a board member candidate after the closing of the possible acquisition, and Mr. William Gray, chairman of Dell's Governance and Nominating Committee, noted that, if Mr. Perot was proposed, the Governance and Nominating Committee would conduct its normal procedures in order to determine whether to nominate Mr. Perot. Dell's cost to acquire Perot Systems, excluding all related fees and expenses, was approximately $3.9 billion. Mr. Perot, as the Chairman of the Board of Perot Systems and the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the outstanding Shares, had a direct or indirect material interest in the Merger. Pursuant to a change in control letter agreement between Perot Systems and Mr. Perot, Mr. Perot received cash severance benefits in connection with the successful completion of the Offer in the amount of $3,954,822 (including a tax-gross up payment of $1,165,353) and a cash payment for his Perot Systems equity awards in the amount of $35,771,400. In addition, Mr. Perot was deemed to be the beneficial owner of 31,747,360 Shares immediately prior to successful completion of the Offer, including 29,655,000 Shares held by a limited partnership of which he was a general partner, 10,000 Shares owned by the Perot Foundation, 5,000 Shares owned by Mr. Perot's spouse, and 2,077,360 Shares owned by two trusts of which Mr. Perot is a beneficiary. Mr. Perot disclaimed beneficial ownership of the Shares held by his spouse and, except to the extent of his pecuniary interest, the Shares owned by the two trusts. The respective holders of these Shares received $30 per Share, for an aggregate of approximately $952.4 million, pursuant to the successful completion of the Offer and the Merger. Concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, Dell and the Purchaser entered into Tender and Voting Agreements (the ""Tender Agreements"") with all executive officers and directors and certain principal stockholders of Perot Systems, including Mr. Perot (the ""Tendering Stockholders""). Pursuant to the Tender Agreements, the Tendering Stockholders agreed, among other things, to tender the Shares held by them on the date of the Tender Agreements or acquired after that date (the ""Covered Shares"") to the Purchaser in the Offer and to vote the Covered Shares in favor of the Merger. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Perot Systems Family Corporation, a Texas corporation, H. Ross Perot and Mr. Perot (collectively, ""Licensor"") and Perot Systems entered into the Third Amended and Restated License Agreement, dated September 20, 2009 (the ""License Agreement""), pursuant to which Licensor grants Perot Systems and its affiliates an exclusive, royalty-free license to use ""Perot Systems"" and ""Perot"" in connection with Perot Systems' current businesses, products, services and charitable activities, and its future operations and activities resulting from the expansion of, and the integration with, Dell's services and businesses. The term of the License Agreement became effective immediately upon execution and will continue until the earlier of (i) the date that is five years from November 3, 2009 or (ii) the date of any termination of the License Agreement for cause. Additionally, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on September 20, 2009, H. Ross Perot and Mr. Perot signed noncompetition agreements with Dell and Perot Systems, as amended by a waiver letter entered into on December 2, 2009, that limit their ability to compete with Perot Systems or solicit its employees or customers for a period ending December 31, 2014. Perot Systems is currently providing information technology and certain other services to Hillwood Enterprise L.P., which is controlled and partially owned by Mr. Perot under an agreement which Perot Systems entered into in January 2007 and will expire in 2017. This contract includes provisions under which Perot Systems may be penalized if its actual performance does not meet the levels of service specified in the contract, and such provisions are consistent with those included in other customer contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2008, in which Perot Systems performed services for Hillwood, Perot Systems recorded revenue of $1,966,881 and operating expense of $1,606,761. During 2002, Perot Systems entered into a sublease agreement with Perot Services Company, LLC, which is controlled and owned by H. Ross Perot, for approximately 23,000 square feet of office space at its Plano, Texas facility. At the expiration of the original lease, a new lease was signed effective October 1, 2007 and expires on September 30, 2015. The office space annual rental is $21.95 per square foot and the storage space rent remains $345.58 per month. The total amount paid to Perot Systems in 2008 under these lease and sublease agreements was $491,130. Perot Systems has a corporate AAirpass program with American Airlines, Inc. under which Perot Systems prepays for mileage that its associates use for business travel. Historically, the use of prepaid miles has resulted in lower travel costs to Perot Systems than refundable tickets for most travel itineraries. Employees of Hillwood Development Company LLC, The Perot Group, and their affiliated corporations, as well as members of the Perot family, also use this AAirpass program. These parties reimburse Perot Systems for the prepaid miles that they use. During 2008, these parties used approximately $880,171 in prepaid miles under Perot Systems' AAirpass program. ...This item was truncated.

47,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2009. On February 27, 2009, Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company reorganized its international structure to provide more direct sales focus in the marketplace.

48,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2009. In connection with a proposed notes offering of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-163621), the Company will include the following disclosure under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the prospectus supplement forming part of the registration statement. In addition to the other information contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2009, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business. Risk Factors Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Business The notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries. The notes are obligations exclusively of Boston Scientific and not of any of our subsidiaries. A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the notes). Consequently, the notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. As of September 30, 2009, before giving effect to this offering, our subsidiaries had approximately $3.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness, consisting primarily of $2.1 billion outstanding under our bank term loan and a $900 million subordinated loan from Abbott Laboratories. In October 2009, we prepaid an additional $250 million of our bank term loan. Our wholly owned subsidiary, BSC International Holding Limited, is the borrower, and Boston Scientific is the guarantor, under the bank term loan and the subordinated loan from Abbott Laboratories. The notes will be effectively junior to any secured indebtedness that we may issue in the future. The notes are unsecured. As of October 31, 2009, we had no secured debt outstanding. Holders of our secured debt that we may issue in the future may foreclose on the assets securing such debt, reducing the cash flow from the foreclosed property available for payment of unsecured debt, including the notes. Holders of our secured debt also would have priority over unsecured creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding. As a result, the notes will be effectively junior to any secured debt that we may issue in the future. We may issue additional notes. Under the terms of the indenture that governs each series of the notes, including the notes offered hereby, we may from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the applicable series of notes, create and issue additional notes of a new or existing series, which notes, if of an existing series, will be equal in rank to the notes of that series in all material respects so that, subject to certain tax considerations, the new notes may be consolidated and form a single series with such notes and have the same terms as to the status, redemption or otherwise as such notes. Redemption may adversely affect your return on the notes. The notes are redeemable at our option, and therefore we may choose to redeem the notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds you receive from the redemption in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on your notes being redeemed. We may not be able to repurchase all of the notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event. As described under ""Description of the Notes Repurchase at the Option of Holders Upon Change of Control Repurchase Event"", we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of Control Repurchase Event, and consummate a Change of Control Offer for all notes then outstanding, at a purchase price for 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Change of Control Payment Date. In addition, a change of control (as described herein) and certain other change of control events would constitute an event of default under certain of our credit agreements. As a result, we may not be able to make any of the required payments on, or repurchases of, the notes without obtaining the consent of the lenders under certain of our credit agreements or have the ability to arrange financing on acceptable terms. The notes do not restrict our ability to incur additional debt or prohibit us from taking other action that could negatively impact holders of the notes. We are not restricted under the terms of the notes or the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional indebtedness. The terms of the indenture limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer all or substantially all of our property and assets, and create, grant or incur liens. However, these limitations are subject to numerous exceptions. See ""Description of Debt Securities"" in the accompanying prospectus. In addition, the notes do not require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture and the notes, including repurchasing indebtedness or capital stock, or paying dividends, could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due. Our financial performance and other factors could adversely impact our ability to make payments on the notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments with respect to our indebtedness, including the notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There is no public market for the notes. The notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no trading market. As a result, we can give no assurances that a market will develop for the notes or that you will be able to sell the notes. If any of the notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price. Future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions, our financial condition and performance, as well as other factors. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the notes for an indefinite period of time. We do not intend to apply for listing or quotation of the notes of either series on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system, respectively. We have undertaken corporate restructurings in the past and we may undertake further restructurings in the future, which are likely to result in pre-tax charges and cash outlays and we cannot assure you that any future restructuring will achieve its intended benefits. From time to time, our management undertakes various cost improvement measures intended to better align operating expenses with our expected revenue levels and reallocate resources to better support growth initiatives intended to improve overall gross profit margins. For example, we undertook a number of restructuring activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan that are expected to result in pre-tax expenses of approximately $425 million to $450 million with approximately $385 million to $405 million of these pre-tax expenses resulting in cash outlays and our 2009 Plant Network Optimization plan that is expected to result in pre-tax charges of approximately $135 million to $150 million with approximately $115 million to $125 million of these charges resulting in cash outlays. We are currently reviewing our operations and corporate structure which may result in the formulation of additional restructuring plans. However, we have not determined the scope of our future restructuring plans. ...This item was truncated.

50,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 08, 2009. (e) On December 9, 2009, the independent members of the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation (""Chevron"") approved a new base salary of $1,500,000 for J.S.

55,DELL,"       Dell Inc. (DELL) filed a Form 8K - Regulation FD Disclosure - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 16, 2009. Dell Inc. (""Dell"") is furnishing under this Item 7.01 a press release and a copy of an investor presentation for the December 16, 2009 Perot Systems Corporation integration conference call. The press release and the investor presentation are furnished herewith as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2. The investor presentation contains information about Dell's non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, which are not measurements of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, as defined by Dell, represent net income and earnings per share as adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses related to Dell's acquisition of Perot Systems Corporation (""Perot Systems""), amortization of purchased intangible assets related to Perot Systems as well as prior acquisitions, organizational effectiveness costs, and stock option accelerated vesting charges. Organizational effectiveness costs include severance and facility actions. Acquisition expense related to Dell's acquisition of Perot Systems consists of acquisition related cash compensation payments, retention bonuses, integration costs, bankers' fees, legal fees, and consulting fees. The investor presentation contains a quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to net income and earnings per share as reported on a GAAP basis. As a result of Dell's acquisition of Perot Systems, Dell incurred significant amounts of acquisition related expenses and will be amortizing a significant amount of purchased intangible assets. Management does not consider these items to be fundamental to Dell's operating performance and as such excludes these items when evaluating Dell's operating performance. In addition, Dell has been, for recent quarters, providing the effects of organizational effectiveness costs, and in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, stock option accelerated vesting charges, to investors to supplement GAAP financial information because Dell's management evaluates the operating performance of the company without these items. Beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, Dell will provide investors with supplemental non-GAAP financial measures and include a reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Dell has included non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share in the furnished presentation to provide information to investors that is consistent with the information Dell's management uses to evaluate operating performance. Dell uses non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to supplement Dell's GAAP financial measures and to facilitate an enhanced understanding of historical results and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. Dell presents the non-GAAP financial measures to investors to provide greater transparency to the information Dell's management uses in its financial and operational decision-making and to allow investors to see Dell's operating results through the eyes of management. Dell further believes that providing this information better enables Dell's investors to understand Dell's operating performance, and to better compare Dell's current financial results with Dell's past financial results. There are, however, limitations to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies, including companies in Dell's industry, may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than Dell does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Dell's management compensates for the foregoing limitations by relying primarily on Dell's GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. Dell provides detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within the financial information included with press releases and in other written materials that include the non-GAAP financial measures, and Dell encourages investors to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of any non-GAAP financial measures. The information in this Item 7.01 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 furnished herewith shall not be deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

59,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 15, 2009. (d) On December 15, 2009, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, elected Nelda J. Connors to the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific effective as of December 15, 2009. Ms. Connors' term will expire at our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 11, 2010. The appointment of Ms. Connors increases the size of our Board to fourteen members. Ms. Connors has been appointed to serve on the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Quality Committee of the Board. There are no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Connors and any other persons pursuant to which Ms. Connors was elected a director of Boston Scientific. In connection with Ms. Connors' election as a non-employee director of the Board, she will receive our standard director compensation, including a cash retainer of $75,000 (pro rated from December 15, 2009) and a restricted stock grant equal to a number of shares of restricted stock determined by dividing $125,000 by the fair market value of our common stock on December 15, 2009. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. (e) 1. 2010 Performance Incentive Plan On December 15, 2009, upon the recommendation of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the ""Compensation Committee""), our Board of Directors approved the 2010 Performance Incentive Plan (the ""2010 PIP"") which is effective January 1, 2010. As part of our overall compensation program, our 2010 PIP provides an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel, including those officers designated as Named Executive Officers in our 2009 Proxy Statement, based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. Under the 2009 Performance Incentive Plan, the performance targets were 75% of salary for all Executive Committee members and 120% of salary for the CEO. Under the 2010 PIP, the Compensation Committee has established a six tier performance target structure with reduced bonus targets ranging from 45% of salary to 100% of salary. For our Named Executive Officers, their bonus targets were set as follows: David McFaul at Tier 4 or 60% of salary, Fredericus A. Colen at Tier 3 or 70% of salary, Sam R. Leno at Tier 2 or 80% of salary, and J. Raymond Elliott at Tier 1 or 100% of salary. Payments to executive officers under the 2010 PIP are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation that is deductible under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. For section 162(m) purposes, funding will be based on attainment of financial goals, and individual and quality goals will be taken into account through the exercise of negative discretion. A copy of the 2010 PIP effective as of January 1, 2010 is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto 2. 2010 Performance Share Program On December 15, 2009, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2010 Performance Share Program (the ""2010 PSP""). Beginning in 2010, performance share awards in the form of Deferred Stock Units will be granted to executive officers and certain other members of our senior management team in order to place additional emphasis on creating long-term stockholder value. The performance shares granted under our 2010 PSP are one equity vehicle within the overall mix of our long-term incentive program and will be awarded under our 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan which was previously approved by stockholders. Under the 2010 PSP, performance will be measured in three annual performance cycles comparing our own Total Shareholder Return to the Total Shareholder Return of the companies in the S&P 500 Healthcare Industry Index. Under this program, Total Shareholder Return will be defined as the change in stock price plus dividends paid over the average closing stock price for the last 60 days of the calendar year prior to the year in which the grant is made. At the end of the three year performance period, final Total Shareholder Return will be calculated using the simple average of the three annual performance cycles. Performance Shares will fully vest after the three year period based on meeting performance requirements approved by the Compensation Committee on the date of grant. A copy of the 2010 PSP is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto. 3. Change in Control Agreements As part of its ongoing evaluation of our executive compensation programs, the Compensation Committee reviewed our existing Retention Agreements and recommended to our Board of Directors certain modifications to better align executive compensation with increasing stockholder value following a change in control. On December 15, 2009, our Board of Directors approved new Change in Control Agreements for our executive officers to replace the existing Retention Agreements. The Change in Control Agreements eliminate the tax gross up provided under the Retention Agreements, limit the payment amount following a change in control to avoid triggering the excise tax, establish a defined three year term, impose a double trigger on equity acceleration and modify the existing definition of ""Good Reason."" We intend to ask each of our eligible executive officers to agree to terminate their existing Retention Agreement and to execute a Change in Control Agreement. In consideration of the executive terminating the Retention Agreement and executing the less favorable Change in Control Agreement, the Compensation Committee has authorized the grant of stock options having a value of $15,000 on the date of grant and vesting over four years to each executive officer who so agrees. A form of the Change in Control Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto. 4. Amendment to 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan On December 15, 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the ""401(k) Plan"") which amends the 401(k) Plan for technical requirements mandated by the Pension Protection Act (the ""PPA"") and further amends certain definitions in the 401(k) Plan, as required by the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS""). A copy of the amendment to the 401(k) Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.4 hereto. 5. Amendment to Guidant Retirement Plan On December 15, 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Guidant Retirement Plan to incorporate the applicable requirements mandated by the PPA, as well as the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act and the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act. A copy of the amendment to the Guidant Retirement Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.5 hereto. 6. Amendment to Global Employee Stock Ownership Plan On December 15, 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Boston Scientific 2006 Global Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ""GESOP"") which amends the GESOP as required by the IRS in response to the final regulations relating to employee stock purchase plans qualifying under section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code released on November 16, 2009.

Under the Joint Venture Agreement, each of MNL and NTC may initially designate five of the twelve members of the Board of Directors of Inotera and each is to vote its shares for such designated directors.

73,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2010. On January 27, 2010, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, cost reduction initiatives, litigation and tax settlements, product launch costs, acquired in-process research and development and gains and losses related to certain investments. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

74,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2010. On January 27, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, ""pro forma"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.

88,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2010. (b) and (c) As described in the press release that is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, on January 27, 2010, Mark A. Humphrey, Vice President and Comptroller of Chevron Corporation (""Chevron""), elected to retire to be effective March 31, 2010. Also on January 27, 2010, to be effective April 1, 2010, the Chevron Board of Directors appointed Matthew J. Foehr to the position of Vice President and Comptroller of Chevron. (e) On January 27, 2010, the independent Directors of the Chevron Board of Directors approved the grant of 340,000 stock options and 53,000 performance shares to J.S. Watson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and ratified the following grants by the Management Compensation Committee under the Long Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (""LTIP""): P.E. Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 135,000 stock options and 21,000 performance shares; and G.L. Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, 190,000 stock options and 30,000 performance shares. Chevron does not have employment agreements with any of the foregoing executive officers. The stock options have a ten year term, and one-third of the grant vests at each anniversary of the date of grant, except as described below in the last paragraph. The exercise price for the stock options is $73.70 per share, which is based on the closing price of Chevron's common stock on January 27, 2010, the date of grant. The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (TSR) for the performance period as compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group (BP p.l.c., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c. and ConocoPhillips). The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the peer group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the modifier will be the average of the sum of all the modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the peer group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. Since Mr. Kirkland has more than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 27, 2010 date of grant will vest upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules. Since Ms. Yarrington and Mr. Watson each have more than 75 points under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 27, 2010 date of grant will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of outstanding shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the grant date to the separation from service date, divided by 36) upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules.

89,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 03, 2010. On February 3, 2010, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal second quarter 2010 ended January 23, 2010. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. In addition, the transcript of a video of the Registrant's Chief Financial Officer discussing second quarter results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data, non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation and non-GAAP inventory turns. Effective for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2010, Cisco no longer uses non-GAAP shares in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation for the periods in which such measures are presented, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the period presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, enhanced early retirement benefits, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; for example, effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Registrant no longer excludes payroll tax on stock option exercises, and effective in fiscal 2010, the Registrant no longer excludes in-process research and development upon acquisition as it is no longer expensed as a result of new accounting guidance. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expenses, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Enhanced early retirement benefits. The Registrant excluded expenses related to an enhanced early retirement program, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Registrant excludes these expenses because the Registrant does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. During the Registrant's fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling. The decision changes the tax treatment of share-based compensation expenses for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While Cisco was not a named party to the case, the decision resulted in a change in Cisco's tax benefits recognized in its financial statements. The Registrant excluded a related tax charge because it was unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Enhanced early retirement benefit expenses are an unusual occurrence. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

On February 6, 2010, the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved, and the Company committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the ""2010 Plan""), designed to strengthen the Company and position it for long-term success. The Company estimates that the Plan will reduce annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $200 million to $250 million once completed in 2011.

The Company anticipates the elimination of 1,000 to 1,300 positions as a result of the execution of the 2010 Plan. Activities under the 2010 Plan will be initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. The Company estimates that the 2010 Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $180 million to $200 million, of which the Company estimates approximately $140 million to $160 million will be recorded in 2010, and that approximately $170 million to $190 million of total charges will result in future cash outlays. The following table provides a summary of the Company's estimates of costs associated with the 2010 Plan by major type of cost: Type of Cost Total Expected Amounts Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $115 million to $125 million Asset write-offs $5 million Other (1) $35 million to $40 million Restructuring-related expenses: Other (2) $25 million to $30 million $180 million to $200 million (1) Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations (2) Includes accelerated depreciation and other costs necessary to implement the 2010 Plan The Company estimates that during the first quarter of 2010, it will record approximately $85 million to $95 million of restructuring charges associated with the 2010 Plan.

107,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on March 04, 2010. This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed by Micron Technology, Inc. (the ""Company"") to retrospectively adjust portions of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 3, 2009 (the ""2009 Form 10-K"") reflecting changes to the Company's accounting for noncontrolling interests, certain convertible debt and its presentation of its reportable segments as described below. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2010, the Company adopted new accounting standards for noncontrolling interests and certain convertible debt instruments, which require retrospective application. The impact of these new standards is summarized below. Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries: Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is (1) reported as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets and (2) included in net income in the statement of operations. Convertible debt instruments: The new standard applies to convertible debt instruments that may be fully or partially settled in cash upon conversion and is applicable to the Company's 1.875% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion issued in May 2007 (the ""Convertible Notes""). The standard requires the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes to be stated separately. The liability component recognized at the issuance of the Convertible Notes equals the estimated fair value of a similar liability without a conversion option and the remainder of the proceeds received at issuance was allocated to equity. In connection therewith, at the May 2007 issuance of the Convertible Notes there was a $402 million decrease in debt, a $394 million increase in additional capital, and an $8 million decrease in deferred debt issuance costs (included in other noncurrent assets). The fair value of the liability was determined using an interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt issued as of the original May 2007 issuance date by entities with credit ratings comparable to the Company's credit rating at the time of issuance. In subsequent periods, the liability component recognized at issuance is increased to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes through the amortization of interest costs. Through fiscal 2009, $107 million of interest was amortized. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company's Imaging segment no longer met the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and management does not expect that Imaging will meet the quantitative thresholds in future years. As a result, Imaging is no longer considered a reportable segment and is included in the Company's All Other nonreportable segments. The impact of the adoption of these new accounting standards and the changed presentation of the Company's reportable segments is reflected in the following sections of the 2009 Form 10-K, which are included as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 99.3, 99.4 and 99.5 (collectively, the ""Exhibits"") to this Current Report on Form 8-K: * Part I, Item 1. Business (Exhibit 99.1); * Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data (Exhibit 99.2); * Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Exhibit 99.3); * Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (Exhibit 99.4); and * Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Exhibit 99.5). Accordingly, the Company has revised the presentation of its noncontrolling interests, certain convertible debt and the presentation of its reportable segments to reflect these changes and has recast all comparative prior period information on this basis. The Company is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to reflect the impact of the adoption of these new accounting standards and the revised presentation of its reportable segments. This will permit the Company to incorporate these financial statements by reference in future SEC filings. This Form 8-K contains only the sections and exhibits to the 2009 Form 10-K that are being revised. The sections of and exhibits to the 2009 Form 10-K as originally filed, which are not included herein, are unchanged and continue in full force and effect as originally filed.

However, instead of receiving long-term stock option and performance based stock unit awards for fiscal year 2011 under the LTIP, the value of which is contingent on the achievement of company-wide performance goals, each participant in the Plan will receive a performance based stock unit award incorporating the Plan's incentive terms. Each award under the Plan will have a performance range of 0% to 400% of the participant's target opportunity and a three-year performance period. Total award value will depend on the achievement of minimum revenue, operating income and cumulative operating income goals for the Communications Solutions unit for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 fiscal years. Participants will earn 100% of target for meeting the goals in one of three years, 250% of target for meeting the goals in two of three years, and 400% of target for meeting the goals in all three years. Awards will be paid out if and when the performance goals are achieved. On March 26, 2010, the Committee granted 260,174 performance based stock units under the Plan to Ronald G.

123,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21, 2010. On April 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the first quarter 2010. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, currency devaluations, legislative reforms, litigation settlements, cost reduction initiatives and product launch costs. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.    (END) Dow Jones Newswires April 21, 2010 08:28 ET (12:28 GMT)",quarterly & annual financial report,"The filing includes Abbott Laboratories' results of operations for the first quarter of 2010, which is characteristic of a quarterly financial report."
124,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21, 2010. On April 21, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Moreover, it is generally not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, ""pro forma"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.

128,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 27, 2010. On April 27, 2010, we announced that the U.S. District Court in Minnesota declined to accept the plea agreement between Guidant and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) related to product advisories issued in 2005, before we acquired Guidant. Instead, the Court invited the parties to consider a modified agreement fashioned to further serve the public interest, including community service, public education and charitable activities, and suggested the DOJ allocate a portion of the settlement funds to Medicare. The Court did not suggest revisions to the remaining terms of the plea agreement. We plan to work with the DOJ in an effort to develop a modified plea agreement that is acceptable to the Court, the DOJ and the Company. In November, Guidant agreed to plead to two misdemeanor charges related to the failure to include information in reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and we agreed to pay $296 million on behalf of Guidant.

131,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2010. On May 12, 2010, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal third quarter 2010 ended May 1, 2010. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. In addition, the transcript of a video of the Registrant's Chief Financial Officer discussing third quarter results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data, non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation and non-GAAP inventory turns. Effective from the second quarter and for the related year-to-date periods of fiscal 2010, Cisco no longer uses non-GAAP shares in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation for the periods in which such measures are presented, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, enhanced early retirement benefits, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; for example, effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Registrant no longer excludes payroll tax on stock option exercises, and effective in fiscal 2010, the Registrant no longer excludes in-process research and development upon acquisition as it is no longer expensed as a result of new accounting guidance. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expenses, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Enhanced early retirement benefits. The Registrant excluded expenses related to an enhanced early retirement program, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Registrant excludes these expenses because the Registrant does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued decisions that affected the tax treatment of share-based compensation expenses for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While Cisco was not a party to the case, as a result of the tax accounting change caused by each ruling, Cisco recorded a tax benefit or charge in its financial statements during the applicable period. The Registrant excluded these items because they were unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Enhanced early retirement benefit expenses are an unusual occurrence. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

132,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2010. This Current Report on Form 8-K revises portions of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Chevron Corporation (""the company"") for the year ended December 31, 2009 to retrospectively reflect subsequent changes in the company's operating segments. The activities reported in the company's upstream and downstream operating segments have changed effective January 1, 2010. Chemicals businesses are now reported as part of the downstream segment. In addition, significant upstream-enabling operations, primarily a gas-to-liquids project and major international export pipelines, have been reclassified from the downstream segment to the upstream segment. As a result of the changes described in the previous paragraph, descriptions of upstream and downstream activities and discussions of segment earnings contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been revised. In addition, the following notes to the financial statements have also been revised: Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies references to operating segments within the disclosures have been revised. Note 8, Lease Commitments table revised to reflect the segment changes. Note 11, Operating Segments and Geographic Data includes discussion of the segment changes and revised tables. Note 12, Investments and Advances table revised to reflect the segment changes. Note 13, Properties, Plant and Equipment table revised to reflect the segment changes. Note 22, Other Contingencies and Commitments discussion of environmental reserves by segment revised. Note 23, Asset Retirement Obligations references to operating segments within the discussion have been revised. The exhibits included under Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K revise the following sections of the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect the subsequent change in our operating segments: Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Part I, and the other items in Part II, of the company's 2009 Form 10-K have not been revised nor included in this Form 8-K. The significant upstream-enabling operations that have been reclassified from downstream to upstream were already described in Part I under the upstream operations they support, as well as separately in the downstream section. Chemicals operations were described in a separate section. The company believes deletion of duplicate disclosures of upstream-enabling operations or the relocation of the separate description of Chemicals operations is not necessary for investors to understand Chevron's businesses. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not reflect events that occurred after February 25, 2010, the date of the company's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and does not modify or update disclosures in any way other than as required to reflect the effects of the changes to the company's reportable segments described above. This filing does not purport to update the information contained in the 2009 Form 10-K for any information, uncertainties, transactions, risks, events or trends occurring, or known to management.

Pursuant to the SHRRA, Micron has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement on Form S-3 (a ""Shelf Registration Statement"") to effect the registration under the Securities Act of any Micron Shares held by any Seller who, as a result of being considered an affiliate of Micron for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (""Rule 144""), is unable to sell its Micron Shares within a three-month period due to the volume limitations generally applicable to affiliates of an issuer under Rule 144 (the ""Registration Conditions""), upon the request of any Seller meeting the Registration Conditions which is made between November 7, 2011 and May 6, 2013. The SHRRA also contains a prohibition on the transfer of Micron Shares by the Sellers prior to the expiration of a six-month lock-up period, subject to customary exceptions for certain permitted transfers. Subject to certain limited exceptions, ST has agreed that in respect of any matter to be voted on by Micron's stockholders, so long as ST and its affiliates beneficially own 5% or more of Micron's outstanding common stock, ST will vote its Micron Shares (and any other Micron voting securities owned by it at such time) in the same manner as recommended by the board of directors of Micron to Micron's shareholders in respect of such matter. In addition, each Seller and its controlled affiliates are subject to certain standstill restrictions under the SHRRA whereby the Sellers have agreed not to, and have agreed to cause their controlled affiliates not to, among other things, acquire any Micron securities, assets or businesses, make or participate in any proxy solicitation in respect of Micron's common stock, or seek to influence or control Micron's board of directors. The standstill restrictions apply until the earlier to occur of (a) May 7, 2013; (b) the consummation of a change in control of Micron; and (c) the date on which such Seller and its affiliates no longer beneficially own 5% or more of Micron's outstanding common stock.

134,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Acquisition or Disposition of Assets - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on May 07, 2010.

Of these Micron Shares, 21,000,000 shares have been placed in escrow for a 12 month period following the closing of the Share Purchase as partial security for the Sellers' indemnity obligations under the Purchase Agreement. In addition, Micron assumed all outstanding restricted stock units (""RSUs"") held by Numonyx employees representing approximately 4.8 million shares of Micron common stock. Micron announced the completion of the Share Purchase in a press release dated May 7, 2010, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Share Purchase is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, which was previously filed as Exhibit 10.88 to Micron's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 10, 2010. Micron's offer and sale of the Micron Shares was conducted as a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), based on the limited nature of the offering and the Sellers' status as accredited investors. Accordingly, the Micron Shares issued in the Share Purchase are restricted within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Subject to certain conditions, the Sellers may require Micron to register the Micron Shares for resale on a Form S-3 registration statement pursuant to the SHRRA as described under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(""Numonyx""), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron""), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Numonyx B.V. (""Numonyx B.V."") holds a minority equity interest in Hynix-Numonyx Semiconductor Ltd. (the ""Hynix JV""), a joint venture with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. (""Hynix"") and Hynix Semiconductor (WUXI) Limited, formed pursuant to a joint venture agreement originally entered into between STMicroelectronics N.V. and Hynix prior to the formation of Numonyx (as amended and restated, the ""JV Agreement""). As previously reported by Micron on a Form 8-K filed on May 13, 2010, Micron completed its acquisition (the ""Share Purchase"") of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Numonyx on May 7, 2010. Under the terms of the JV Agreement, the consummation of the Share Purchase gave rise to certain rights of the parties to the JV Agreement to buy or sell or cause the other party to buy or sell their interests in the Hynix JV, including the right of Hynix to purchase all of Numonyx B.V.'s interests in the Hynix JV (the ""Hynix Call Option""). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, the exercise price of the Hynix Call Option is an amount equal to the positive difference between the book value of the Hynix JV's total assets and the book value of the Hynix JV's total liabilities multiplied by Numonyx B.V.'s percentage ownership in the Hynix JV. On May 28, 2010, Hynix delivered notice to Numonyx B.V. of its exercise of the Hynix Call Option. The notice references an estimated purchase price of approximately $423 million for Numonyx B.V.'s 20.71% interest in the Hynix JV. The terms and conditions of the transfer of Numonyx B.V.'s stake in the Hynix JV in settlement of the Hynix Call Option (such transfer, the ""Equity Transfer""), including the mechanics for the determination of the final purchase price based on the net book value of the Hynix JV's assets and liabilities as of the closing of the Equity Transfer, will be set forth in an equity transfer agreement to be negotiated and entered into by Hynix and Numonyx B.V. Pursuant to the terms of the JV Agreement, the closing of the Equity Transfer is to take place on the later of (i) August 10, 2010 (the date specified in the notice delivered by Hynix) and (ii) the fifth (5th) business day following receipt of the last of any required consents or approvals or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods in respect of the Equity Transfer. JV Supply Agreement Pursuant to the terms of the June 13, 2005 supply agreement (the ""JV Supply Agreement"") between the Hynix JV and Numonyx B.V. (which assumed the agreement from ST in connection with the formation of Numonyx), the Hynix JV is permitted to terminate the supply agreement upon the consummation of the Equity Transfer. On May 28, 2010, the Hynix JV delivered notice to Numonyx B.V. of its intent to terminate the JV Supply Agreement concurrent with the closing of the Equity Transfer. A significant portion of Numonyx's revenue is dependent upon sales of products supplied to it by the Hynix JV pursuant to the JV Supply Agreement. Upon termination of the JV Supply Agreement, the Hynix JV shall have no further supply obligations to Numonyx B.V. While Micron is working with Hynix in order to secure continuity of supply of these products following termination of the JV Supply Agreement, there is no guarantee that Micron will be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms. DBS Loan Arrangements As previously reported by Micron on a Form 8-K filed on February 11, 2010, concurrent with the execution of the purchase agreement in respect of the Share Purchase, Micron, ST and Numonyx B.V. entered into a framework agreement (the ""Framework Agreement"") pursuant to which Numonyx B.V. has agreed to take certain actions in connection with the outstanding US$250,000,000 loan (the ""Loan"") by DBS Bank Ltd. (""DBS"") to the Hynix JV in the event Hynix elects to exercise the Hynix Call Option. In particular, Numonyx B.V. has agreed that, subject to certain limited conditions, within two (2) business days after receipt of the proceeds from the Equity Transfer, it will deposit $250,000,000 of such proceeds into a pledged account at DBS. The funds deposited into such account will secure Numonyx B.V.'s obligations under a guarantee of the Loan, which guarantee is to be entered into by Numonyx B.V. concurrent with such deposit. The amount on deposit in the DBS account will be accounted for as ""restricted cash"" on the balance sheet of Numonyx B.V.

Holders may convert their Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2013 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2010 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the ""measurement period"") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 15, 2013 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted, determined in the manner set forth in the Indenture. The Company may not redeem the Notes and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require the Company to repurchase the Notes in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The Notes and common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or any state securities laws. The Notes were offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act). In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes or their affiliates (in such capacity, collectively, the ""option counterparties""). Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the full number of shares of the Company's common stock initially underlying the Notes, with a strike price initially equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes and with a cap price initially equal to approximately $37.16 (or approximately 48% higher than the last reported sale price per share of the Company's common stock on June 8, 2010 of $25.11), in each case subject to certain anti-dilutive or anti-concentrative adjustments. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes, subject to the cap price. The capped call transactions will generally have the economic effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the notes to that of the cap price. The foregoing summary of the Indenture (including the Form of the Notes) is qualified in its entirety by the terms the Indenture. Please refer to the Indenture (including the Form of Notes), which is incorporated herein by reference, and a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

157,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on June 23, 2010. On June 23, 2010, Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") entered into a $3,000,000,000 senior unsecured credit facility, dated as of June 23, 2010, by and among the Company, as Borrower, BSC International Holding Limited, as Term Loan Borrower, the several Lenders parties thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the ""Credit Agreement""). The Company plans to use the term loan proceeds to immediately pre-pay in full its $900,000,000 term loan due to Abbott Laboratories in April 2011. The Company also expects to use a portion of the revolving credit facility, together with cash on hand, to fund the repayment of $850,000,000 of its senior notes maturing in January 2011 and June 2011. The initial borrowing under the Credit Agreement consists of a term loan to BSC International Holding Limited, guaranteed by the Company, in the principal amount of $1,000,000,000 (the ""Term Loan Facility""). In addition, the Company may borrow from time to time up to $2,000,000,000 in revolving credit loans (the ""Revolving Facility"") under the Credit Agreement. The credit facilities mature on June 23, 2013, with up to two one-year extension options subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan Facility also requires quarterly principal payments in the amount of $50,000,000 commencing on September 30, 2011 with the remaining principal amount due at the credit facility maturity date. Loans under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility will each bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin. The applicable interest margin will be based on the Company's long-term, senior unsecured, corporate credit ratings from Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investor Service Inc., and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. The interest margin with respect to Eurodollar loans under the Revolving Facility will be between 1.75 percent (low A rating) and 3.25 percent (mid BB rating). Based on the Company's current credit ratings, term loan borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75 percent and any borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25 percent. In addition, the Company is required to pay a facility fee (currently 0.50 percent per year) based on the Company's credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitments (regardless of usage) under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.85 to 1.0 on or prior to March 31, 2011 and 3.5 to 1.0 thereafter. The ratios are calculated based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"" as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Company will be permitted to exclude from EBITDA all net litigation charges and credits until such items are paid or received, and any net cash litigation payments provided that the sum shall not exceed $1,500,000,000 plus up to $1,310,000,000 of cash payments related to legal matters that are probable and estimable and were recorded in the Company's financial statements as of March 31, 2010. In addition, the Company may exclude from EBITDA any cash and non-cash charges with respect to restructuring, plant closings, staff reductions, distributor network optimization initiatives, distribution technology optimization initiatives or other similar charges, provided that the aggregate amount of all charges shall not exceed $300,000,000 plus $285,000,000 of such remaining charges related to previously announced restructuring-related actions.

172,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21, 2010. On July 21, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using pro forma information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Pro forma information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing pro forma tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, ""pro forma"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and pro forma results are presented in the attached press release.

173,DELL,"       Dell Inc. (DELL) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22, 2010. On July 22, 2010, Dell Inc. issued a press release announcing that it had reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") resolving the previously-reported SEC investigation into Dell's disclosures and alleged omissions prior to fiscal year 2008 regarding certain aspects of its commercial relationship with Intel Corporation (""Intel"") and into separate accounting and financial reporting matters. The SEC has agreed to settlements with both the company and Michael Dell, who serves as the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The company and Mr. Dell entered into the settlements without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, as is consistent with standard SEC practice. The settlements with the company and Mr. Dell are subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The SEC's complaint filed with the U.S. District Court on July 22, 2010 alleges that the company engaged in disclosure and accounting practices that violated certain federal securities laws and SEC rules (including antifraud provisions) during the period from 2001 to 2006. The complaint alleges that the company's SEC reports and other public statements during the applicable period contained materially misleading statements and omissions regarding the company's receipt of certain payments from Intel and the effect of such payments on the company's operating results. The complaint further alleges that the company engaged in separate fraudulent and improper accounting for the applicable fiscal periods through its maintenance and use of certain reserve and accrued liability accounts. Under its settlement, the company has consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of antifraud provisions, non-scienter (negligence) based fraud provisions and other non-fraud based provisions related to reporting, the maintenance of accurate books and records, and internal accounting controls under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 under the Exchange Act. The company also has agreed to perform certain undertakings, including retaining an independent consultant, to enhance its disclosure processes, practices and controls. In addition, the company has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100 million. As reported in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the company had established a reserve in that amount for the potential settlement of the SEC investigation. The SEC's allegations with respect to Mr. Dell and his settlement are limited to the alleged failure to provide adequate disclosures with respect to the company's commercial relationship with Intel prior to fiscal year 2008. Mr. Dell's settlement does not involve any of the separate accounting fraud charges being settled by the company and others. Moreover, Mr. Dell's settlement is limited to claims in which only negligence, and not fraudulent intent, is required to establish liability, as well as secondary liability claims for other non-fraud charges.

177,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2010. Equity Transfer Agreement As previously reported by Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron"") on a Form 8-K filed on May 13, 2010, Micron completed its acquisition (the ""Share Purchase"") of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Numonyx Holdings B.V. (""Numonyx"") on May 7, 2010. Also, as previously reported by Micron on a Form 8-K filed on June 3, 2010, Numonyx, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Numonyx B.V. (""Numonyx B.V.""), holds a minority equity interest in Hynix-Numonyx Semiconductor Ltd. (the ""Hynix JV""), a joint venture with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. (""Hynix"") and Hynix Semiconductor (WUXI) Limited, formed pursuant to a joint venture agreement originally entered into between STMicroelectronics N.V. and Hynix prior to the formation of Numonyx (as amended and restated, the ""JV Agreement""). Under the terms of the JV Agreement, the consummation of the Share Purchase gave rise to certain rights of the parties to the JV Agreement to buy or sell or cause the other party to buy or sell their interests in the Hynix JV, including the right of Hynix to purchase all of Numonyx B.V.'s equity interests in the Hynix JV (the ""Hynix Call Option""). On May 28, 2010, Hynix delivered notice to Numonyx B.V. of its exercise of the Hynix Call Option. The terms and conditions of the sale and transfer of Numonyx B.V.'s stake in the Hynix JV in settlement of the Hynix Call Option (such sale and transfer, the ""Equity Transfer""), including the mechanics for the determination of the final purchase price to be paid by Hynix based on the net book value of the Hynix JV's assets and liabilities as of the closing of the Equity Transfer, are set forth in the JV Agreement and an equity transfer agreement entered into between Numonyx B.V. and Hynix on July 29, 2010 (the ""ETA""). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the ETA, including the regulatory approval discussd below, Numonyx B.V. has agreed to sell, and Hynix has agreed to purchase, all of Numonyx B.V.'s equity interests in the Hynix JV (representing approximately 19.34% of the registered capital of the Hynix JV) for an estimated purchase price of $422.89 million (the ""Initial Purchase Price""). Hynix has deposited an amount equal to the initial purchase price in an escrow account with a commercial bank in Singapore (the ""Escrow Account""). The Initial Purchase Price is subject to a pre-closing adjustment based on the Hynix JV's estimate of the book value of its assets and liabilities as of the closing date. Following the closing, the purchase price determined on the closing date is subject to further adjustment based on the actual book value of the Hynix JV's assets and liabilities as of the closing date to be determined at a later date. Pursuant to the laws of the People's Republic of China (the ""PRC""), the parties are required to submit the ETA to provincial and local PRC authorities (the ""Approval Authority"") for review and approval.

(as Numonyx B.V. assumed the agreement from ST in connection with the formation of Numonyx), the Hynix JV is permitted to terminate the supply agreement upon the consummation of the Equity Transfer. On May 28, 2010, the Hynix JV delivered notice to Numonyx B.V. of its intent to terminate the JV Supply Agreement concurrent with the closing of the Equity Transfer.

180,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 2010. On August 11, 2010, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010 ended July 31, 2010. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. In addition, the transcript of a video of the Registrant's Chief Financial Officer discussing fourth quarter and fiscal year results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data, non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation and non-GAAP inventory turns. Effective from the second quarter and for the related year-to-date periods of fiscal 2010, Cisco no longer uses non-GAAP shares in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation for the periods in which such measures are presented, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; for example, effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Registrant no longer excludes payroll tax on stock option exercises, and effective in fiscal 2010, the Registrant no longer excludes in-process research and development upon acquisition as it is no longer expensed as a result of new accounting guidance. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures, when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Registrant excluded impairments and other charges for excess facilities. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Registrant excluded restructuring expenses related to an enhanced early retirement program. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued decisions that affected the tax treatment of share-based compensation expense for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While Cisco was not a party to the case, as a result of the tax accounting change caused by each ruling, Cisco recorded a tax benefit or charge in its financial statements during the applicable period. The Registrant excluded these items because they were unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

The Bylaw Amendment eliminated supermajority vote requirements with respect to specified matters that had conformed to the supermajority vote requirements formerly contained in Article Ninth of the Certificate of Incorporation. The vote requirements eliminated by the Bylaw Amendment had provided that Dell's stockholders could not alter, amend, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, or repeal any specified Bylaw provision without the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 % of the company's outstanding voting stock. The Bylaw provisions that were subject to the supermajority vote requirements before effectiveness of the Bylaw Amendment govern the following matters: place of stockholder meetings; special meetings of stockholders; stockholder action without a meeting; special meetings of the Board of Directors; removal of directors; nomination of directors and stockholder business at annual or special meetings of stockholders; and amendment of the Bylaws. As a result of the effectiveness of the Bylaw Amendment and the related amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation described under Item 8.01 of this report, all future amendments to the Bylaws submitted for approval by Dell's stockholders, including amendments to provisions formerly requiring approval by a 66 % stockholder vote, will require approval by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the company's stock entitled to vote on the amendments who are present or represented by proxy at a meeting of stockholders. The foregoing description of the Bylaw Amendment is qualified in all respects by reference to the text of the Bylaw Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this report and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.03.

As previously reported by Micron on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 11, 2010, concurrent with the execution of the purchase agreement to acquire Numonyx Holdings B.V. (""Numonyx Holdings""), Micron entered into a framework agreement (the ""Framework Agreement"") with Numonyx and STMicroelectronics N.V. pursuant to which Numonyx agreed to take certain actions in connection with an outstanding $250 million loan (the ""Loan"") made by DBS to Hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd., a joint venture in which Numonyx was a party at the time Micron acquired Numonyx Holdings (the ""JV""). Numonyx agreed that, subject to certain limited conditions, within two (2) business days after receipt of the proceeds (the ""Proceeds"") from the sale and transfer of Numonyx's stake in the JV (the ""Equity Transfer""), it would enter into a guarantee, charge and deposit document (the ""GCDD"") with DBS to guaranty the Loan and, concurrent with entering into the GCDD, deposit a portion of the Proceeds in an amount equal to $250 million into a bank account at DBS (the ""Pledged Account"") to secure its obligations under the GCDD. As reported below, the Equity Transfer was consummated on August 31, 2010. Numonyx also entered into the GCDD on August 31, 2010. Description of the GCDD Under the GCDD, Numonyx has guaranteed punctual payment by the JV of all amounts owing to DBS or incurred by DBS in connection with the Loan and the GCDD, and has agreed to immediately pay to DBS, upon demand by DBS, any amounts that the JV fails to pay in accordance with the terms of the facility agreement between the JV and DBS that evidences the Loan (the ""Loan Agreement""). Furthermore, Numonyx has agreed under the GCDD to indemnify DBS against all costs, losses and liabilities suffered by DBS if any obligation of the JV guaranteed by Numonyx is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal. Numonyx's obligations under the GCDD are secured by the Pledged Account. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Numonyx's liability under the GCDD is capped at the amount on deposit in the Pledged Account, which shall never exceed $250 million. The Loan Agreement is governed by the laws of Singapore and requires the JV to comply with customary covenants and restrictions on the JV's ability to, among other things, dispose of certain assets, engage in certain transactions, incur indebtedness and pay dividends. The Loan Agreement also provides for customary events of default for a facility of this size and type. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, DBS may, at its option, accelerate the loans outstanding under the Loan Agreement. Upon any default by the JV under the Loan Agreement that would entitle DBS to enforce its security against the Pledged Account, the GCDD provides that if Numonyx delivers a notice to DBS, then Numonyx will have, either directly or indirectly through DBS acting as agent for Numonyx, the customary rights and remedies of a secured creditor against the JV. These rights and remedies are subject to certain existing intercreditor arrangements in respect of two tranches of senior secured debt of the JV, as well as to applicable laws and regulations governing the enforcement of secured obligations in the People's Republic of China, Singapore and any other applicable jurisdiction.

On September 10, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the ""Company"") adopted and approved an amendment and restatement (the ""Amendment"") of the Company's Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (the ""ERMCP""). Under the ERMCP, eligible employees and members of the Company's Board of Directors can elect to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Deferred amounts are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company, and the Company provides matching credits equal to 50% of the eligible employee's deferrals up to the remainder of (1) 10% of the eligible employee's total compensation for the applicable plan year, reduced by (2) 50% of the maximum 401(k) plan contribution limit established under section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), for the plan year, determined without regard to ""catch-up contributions"" pursuant to Code section 414(v). The matching amounts are credited and paid in Company common stock. Deferrals and matching amounts are paid upon termination of service with the Company. Both under the previous ERMCP and the Amendment, members of the Company's Board of Directors do not receive matching credits for their deferrals. Before the Amendment, matching amounts were credited to the accounts of eligible employees on a quarterly basis based on deferrals made during the quarter and the average closing price of Company common stock during the ten-trading-day period preceding the last day of the quarter. Matching amounts credited for any year vested (1) in full upon an eligible employee's death, disability, attainment of age 65 while employed with the Company, or involuntary termination of employment without Cause (as defined in the ERMCP) or voluntary termination of employment for Good Reason (as defined in the ERMCP) (in both cases within 24 months after a change in control of the Company); (2) in five annual installments beginning when an eligible employee attains age 61 and completes three years of service, so long as the eligible employee is employed by the Company on each vesting date; or (3) in four annual installments beginning on the first day of the second plan year after the year in which the matching amounts were credited to the eligible employee's account, so long as the eligible employee is employed by the Company on each vesting date and deferred amounts into the ERMCP during the year immediately preceding the year in which the vesting date occurs. Under the Amendment, effective January 1, 2011, an eligible employee will receive matching amounts for a calendar year only if he or she is actively employed on the first day of the next calendar year or is terminated without Cause during the calendar year. The matching amounts continue to be credited and paid in shares of Company common stock, but the number of shares to be credited will be determined based on the average closing price of Company common stock during a 200-trading-day period preceding the date on which the matching contributions are credited. Under the Amendment, effective September 27, 2010, all matching amounts vest in full upon an eligible employee's death, disability, attainment of age 65 while employed with the Company, involuntary termination of employment without Cause or voluntary termination of employment for Good Reason (in both cases within 24 months after a change in control of the Company), or completion of two continuous years of service with the Company commencing with the employee's date of hire. The Amendment also specifies that cash dividends on Company common stock will be credited to an eligible employee's account in the form of additional shares, which are subject to the same terms and vesting and payment dates as the matching amounts to which they relate, with fractional shares to be paid in cash within 30 days after the payment date of the Company contributions. The preceding summary description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

On October 20, 2010, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the third quarter 2010. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, currency devaluations, legislative reforms, litigation settlements, acquired in-process research and development, cost reduction initiatives, asset impairments, product recalls and withdrawals and product launch costs. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

212,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2010. On October 28, 2010, Boston Scientific Corporation announced the execution of a definitive agreement under which Stryker Corporation will acquire Boston Scientific's Neurovascular business. The purchase price is $1.5 billion, payable in cash, of which $1.4 billion is payable at closing and $100 million will be payable following the closing and upon the occurrence of the commercialization of the next-generation Target(tm) Detachable Coils and the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which is anticipated to occur over a period of approximately 24 months. The Company expects to record a gain upon closing in excess of $500 million, excluding any impact of the receipt of future milestone payments. Total after-tax proceeds, assuming the achievement of these milestones, are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. The Company expects to allocate approximately half of the net proceeds to acquisitions and the remainder to the retirement of pre-payable debt. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and satisfaction of other customary conditions. As a result of the divestiture, the Company expects 2011 earnings per share to be diluted by approximately four to six cents on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. The Company will provide transitional services to Stryker through a transition services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. During the transition period, products will generally be sold to Stryker at cost, with minimal contribution to Boston Scientific's gross profit. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of approximately 24 months following the closing of the transaction, subject to extension. Due to the Company's continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the planned divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, all historical financial results of the Neurovascular business will continue to be included in the Company's results from continuing operations for all periods presented. In periods subsequent to closing, the Company's results will include only net sales to Stryker and an immaterial amount of gross profit related to those sales.

215,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2010. On October 28, 2010, the Company entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the ""2014 Notes"") to exchange in a private placement (the ""Exchange Transaction"") $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes for $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of new 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the ""New Notes"") of the Company. In addition to the Exchange Transaction, the Company also entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 2014 Notes to repurchase $175.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes for $170.6 million in cash (the ""2014 Notes Repurchase"").

The Company also entered into separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the ""2013 Notes"") to repurchase $91.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes for $166.5 million in cash (the ""2013 Notes Repurchase""). The Company expects that the issuance of New Notes in the Exchange Transaction, the 2014 Notes Repurchase and the 2013 Notes Repurchase will each close on November 3, 2010. The New Notes will have an interest rate of 1.875% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2011. The New Notes will mature on June 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The New Notes will have an initial conversion rate of 91.7431 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (""Common Stock""), per $1,000 principal amount of New Notes, subject to adjustment, and will be convertible into (a) cash up to the aggregate principal amount of New Notes, and (b) shares of the Company's Common Stock or cash, at the Company's election, for the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation. Prior to March 1, 2027, such conversion will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the indenture for the New Notes. Holders of the New Notes who convert their New Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control (as defined in the indenture for the New Notes) will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, (i) in the event of a change in control or (ii) on June 1, 2017, holders of the New Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The Company may elect to redeem all or any portion of the New Notes on or after June 1, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Company may elect to terminate the conversion right of the New Notes if the daily volume weighted average price of the Company's Common Stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period. If the Company terminates the conversion right prior to June 1, 2014, each holder whose New Notes are converted prior to such termination of the conversion right will receive an additional make-whole payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of unpaid interest payments that would have been payable on the converted New Notes from the last day through which interest was paid on the New Notes to, but excluding, June 1, 2014. Subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture for the New Notes, the Company may, at its election, deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of cash with respect to this make-whole payment.

219,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 03, 2010. On November 3, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 26, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as ""Non-GAAP."" Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

220,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 03, 2010. On November 3, 2010, the Company issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the ""New Notes"") in exchange for $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the ""2014 Notes""). The New Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of November 3, 2010 (the ""Indenture""), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The New Notes have an interest rate of 1.875% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2011. The New Notes will mature on June 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The New Notes have an initial conversion rate of 91.7431 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (""Common Stock""), per $1,000 principal amount of New Notes, subject to adjustment, and are convertible, subject to the conditions specified below, into (a) cash up to the aggregate principal amount of New Notes, and (b) shares of the Company's Common Stock or cash, at the Company's election, for the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation. Holders of the New Notes may convert their New Notes on or after March 1, 2027 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to March 1, 2027, holders of the New Notes may convert their New Notes under any of the following circumstances: During any calendar quarter beginning after December 31, 2010 (and only during such calendar quarter) if the closing price of the Company's Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the conversion price; If the New Notes have been called for redemption; If specified distributions to holders of the Company's Common Stock are made, or specified corporate events occur; During the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of New Notes for each trading day of that period is less than 98% of the product of the closing price of the Company's Common Stock and the conversion rate of the New Notes; or upon the Company's election to terminate the conversion right of the New Notes. Holders of the New Notes who convert their New Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control (as defined in the Indenture) will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, (i) in the event of a change in control or (ii) on June 1, 2017, holders of the New Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The Company may elect to redeem all or any portion of the New Notes on or after June 1, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The following events are considered ""Events of Default,"" which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the New Notes: the Company's failure to pay when due the principal on any of the New Notes at maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise; the Company's failure to pay interest, including any additional interest, on any of the New Notes for 30 days after the date when due; the Company's failure to give timely notice of a termination of trading, a change of control or a make-whole change in control that does not constitute a change in control, which continues for a period of three business days; the Company's failure to comply with its obligation to convert the New Notes into Common Stock upon exercise of a holder's conversion right; the Company's failure to comply with any other agreement under the Indenture or in the New Notes and the Company fails to cure or obtain a waiver of such default for a period of 60 days after receiving notice of such failure as required by the Indenture; a default by the Company under any indebtedness that results in acceleration of such indebtedness, or the failure to pay any such indebtedness at maturity, in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $100 million, and such indebtedness has not been discharged or the acceleration has not been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled within 30 days after receiving notice as required by the Indenture; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company or any significant subsidiary. The Company may elect to terminate the conversion right of the New Notes if the daily volume weighted average price of the Company's Common Stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period. If the Company terminates the conversion right prior to June 1, 2014, each holder whose New Notes are converted prior to such termination of the conversion right will receive an additional make-whole payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of unpaid interest payments that would have been payable on the converted New Notes from the last day through which interest was paid on the New Notes to, but excluding, June 1, 2014. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company may, at its election, deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu of cash with respect to this make-whole payment. A copy of the Indenture is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

223,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2010. On November 10, 2010, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal first quarter 2011 ended October 30, 2010. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data, non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation and non-GAAP inventory turns. Effective from the second quarter of fiscal 2010, Cisco no longer uses non-GAAP shares in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP shares used in net income per share calculation for the periods in which such measures are presented, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Registrant excluded impairments and other charges for excess facilities. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued decisions that affected the tax treatment of share-based compensation expense for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While the Registrant was not a party to the case, as a result of the tax accounting change caused by each ruling, the Registrant recorded a tax benefit or charge in its financial statements during the applicable period. The Registrant excluded these items because they were unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

239,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 14, 2010. (d) On December 14, 2010, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, elected Kristina M. Johnson, Ph.D. to the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific effective as of January 1, 2011. Dr. Johnson previously served as a member of our Board of Directors from April 2006 to May 2009 before accepting an appointment as Under Secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy. Dr. Johnson's term will expire at our next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The appointment of Dr. Johnson increases the size of our Board of Directors to thirteen members. Dr. Johnson has been appointed to serve on the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the ""Compensation Committee"") of the Board of Directors. There are no arrangements or understandings between Dr. Johnson and any other person pursuant to which she was appointed as a director. In accordance with our non-employee director compensation program, Dr. Johnson will receive our standard director compensation, which includes an annual cash retainer of $75,000 and a restricted stock grant equal to a number of shares of restricted stock determined by dividing $125,000 by the closing price of our common stock on January 3, 2011, the first business day following the effective date of her election. For a more detailed description of our non-employee director compensation program, please see the ""Director Compensation"" section of our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, filed March 26, 2010. A copy of our press release announcing Dr. Johnson's appointment is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. (e) 1. 2011 Performance Share Program. On December 14, 2010, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the adoption of the 2011 Performance Share Program (the ""2011 PSP""). Under the 2011 PSP, performance share awards will be granted to our executive officers and certain members of our senior management team in the form of deferred stock units in order to continue placing additional emphasis on creating long-term stockholder value. The performance share awards granted under our 2011 PSP are one equity vehicle within the overall mix of our long-term incentive program and will be awarded under our 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan which was previously approved by our stockholders. Under the 2011 PSP, performance will be measured in three annual performance cycles comparing our own Total Shareholder Return to the Total Shareholder Return of the companies in the S&P 500 Healthcare Industry Index. Under this program, Total Shareholder Return for each performance cycle will be defined as the change in stock price plus dividends paid during the performance cycle over the beginning stock price for the performance cycle. The stock price for a specific date, for purposes of this calculation, is determined by the average closing stock price for the two calendar months prior to that date. At the end of the three year performance period, final Total Shareholder Return will be calculated using the simple average of the three annual performance cycles. Performance share awards will fully vest after the three year period based on meeting performance requirements approved by the Compensation Committee on the date of grant. A copy of the 2011 PSP, effective as of January 1, 2011, is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. 2. Amended and Restated 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan.

240,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2010. On December 17, 2010, we received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest based on an audit of the 2001, 2002, and 2003 tax years of Guidant Corporation, which we acquired in April 2006, and its subsidiary businesses as they existed in that time-frame. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Guidant claim is $525.1 million plus interest. We previously disclosed the receipt in 2008 of a Revenue Agent's Report for Guidant containing significant proposed adjustments and our expectation that we would not be able to resolve the matter through applicable IRS administrative procedures. These Notices of Deficiency are materially consistent with the 2008 Revenue Agent's Report. The primary issue under dispute relates to transfer pricing in connection with technology license agreements between certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment. The Company believes that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations and that the previously reported income tax for the years in question is appropriate. We believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we intend to file a timely petition to the Tax Court to contest the assessment. No payments on the assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with this matter are adequate and that the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, both the final resolution and potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like ""anticipate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""believe,"" ""plan,"" ""estimate,"" ""intend"" and similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's beliefs, assumptions and estimates using information available to the Company at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our opinions with respect to: the strength of our tax position with respect to this matter, the final resolution of this matter and expected timing thereof, the adequacy of tax reserves for this matter; and our financial performance. If the Company's underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by the Company's forward-looking statements. These factors, in some cases, have affected and in the future (together with other factors) could affect the Company's ability to implement our business strategy and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed in this Current Report. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements.

All of these factors are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of them are beyond the Company's control.

247,CVS,"       CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 30, 2010. On December 30, 2010, CVS Caremark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""CVS Caremark""), Universal American Corp., a New York corporation (""Universal American""), and Ulysses Merger Sub, L.L.C., a New York limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Caremark (""Purchaser""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Purchaser will merge with and into Universal American (the ""Merger""), with Universal American surviving the Merger as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Caremark. Prior to the Merger, Universal American will transfer its non-Medicare Prescription Drug businesses, including its Medicare Advantage and Traditional Insurance businesses, to a newly-formed company (""NewCo""), as further described below, and Universal American's shareholders will receive shares in NewCo as a portion of the consideration payable in the Merger (the ""Split-Off""). After giving effect to the Merger and the Split-Off, CVS Caremark will have acquired Universal American's Medicare Prescription Drug Business, and Universal American's non-Medicare Prescription Drug operations will be continued by NewCo as a separate company. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Universal American, par value $0.01 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) the cash consideration described below and (ii) one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of NewCo. The Merger is subject to (i) the approval of the holders of 66 2/3% of Universal American's outstanding common stock, (ii) the receipt of all regulatory approvals, including antitrust, and (iii) certain other customary closing conditions. The aggregate amount of cash consideration payable to the shareholders of Universal American will be determined prior to the effective time of the Merger in accordance with a formula set forth in the Merger Agreement. The initial aggregate cash consideration of $1.25 billion will be increased by an amount determined to be excess capital in Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, the principal entity that operates Universal American's Medicare Prescription Drug business, as of December 31, 2010, and decreased by the amount of Universal American's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities and certain other amounts. The resulting aggregate cash consideration will be divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares of Universal American's common stock to arrive at the per share cash consideration payable in the Merger. In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Universal American, NewCo and CVS Caremark entered into a Separation Agreement dated as of December 30, 2010, pursuant to which Universal American will separate the Medicare Prescription Drug Business from its other businesses prior to the Split-Off. Also in connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, CVS Caremark entered into Voting Agreements (collectively, the ""Voting Agreements"") dated as of December 30, 2010 with Capital Z Partners III, L.P., Capital Z Financial Services Fund II, L.P., Capital Z Financial Services Private Fund II, L.P., Lee-Universal Holdings, LLC, Perry Corp., Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe X, L.P., and Richard A. Barasch, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Universal American (the ""Covered Shareholders""). Pursuant to the Voting Agreements, at any meeting of Universal American's shareholders, or in connection with any written consent of Universal American's shareholders, the Covered Shareholders must vote their shares of Universal American common stock (which represent, in the aggregate, approximately 55% of Universal American's outstanding common stock as of December 30, 2010) in favor of the Merger and against any alternative proposals regarding the sale of Universal American. However, if Universal American's board of directors changes its recommendation to Universal American's shareholders in favor of the Merger in connection with a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the aggregate number of shares held by the Covered Shareholders that are subject to the Voting Agreements will be reduced to 45% of Universal American's outstanding common stock. The Voting Agreements terminate upon the earlier of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (ii) the effective time of the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for each of CVS Caremark and Universal American, and if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Universal American is required to pay CVS Caremark a termination fee of $36 million and reimburse CVS Caremark for its out-of-pocket transaction-related expenses up to $5 million. The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Universal American, CVS Caremark and Purchaser. In addition to certain other covenants, Universal American has agreed not to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any takeover proposal from a third party; (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information relating to Universal American to, any third party in connection with any takeover proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement relating to a takeover proposal, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Voting Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are filed as Exhibits hereto and are incorporated into this report by reference. The Merger Agreement governs the contractual rights between the parties in relation to the Merger. The Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about CVS Caremark or Universal American in CVS Caremark's or Universal American's public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to CVS Caremark or Universal American. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement have been negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable under the securities laws.

260,GM,"       General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Unregistered Sales of Equity - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 13, 2011. On January 13, 2011, General Motors Company (GM) completed the previously announced voluntary contribution of 60.6 million shares of GM common stock to its U.S. hourly and salaried pension plan trusts, valued at approximately $2.2 billion for funding purposes. There were 40.4 million shares (valued at approximately $1.5 billion) contributed to the hourly pension plan trust and 20.2 million shares (valued at approximately $0.7 billion) to the salaried pension plan trust. This contribution completes the estimated $6.0 billion contribution that was announced in October 2011 consisting of $4.0 billion in cash and $2.0 billion in stock. This is a voluntary contribution that is above GM's required minimum funding of the pension plans. However, we expect that the contribution will improve the funded status of the Pension Plans and therefore improve GM's risk profile. The contributed shares qualify as a plan asset for funding purposes immediately, and will qualify as a plan asset for accounting purposes once certain transfer restrictions are removed in the near-term. The common stock was issued and contributed to the pension plan trusts in an unregistered transaction in accordance with an exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

The full text of the release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

263,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 26, 2011. On January 26, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, currency devaluations, legislative reforms, litigation settlements and reserves, acquired in-process research and development, cost reduction initiatives, asset impairments, product recalls and withdrawals and product launch costs. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.    (END) Dow Jones Newswires January 26, 2011 08:17 ET (13:17 GMT)",quarterly & annual financial report,The filing includes the announcement of Abbott Laboratories' results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
264,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 26, 2011. On January 26, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2010. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as ""Non-GAAP."" Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2009, the Company included the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because it had previously occurred with relative frequency and was included in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2009 as the credit had been extended prior to the release of the fiscal 2009 business outlook. In fiscal 2011, however, the Company did not include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because the Company had not included the potential extension of the credit in its previously released fiscal 2011 business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit would be retroactively extended. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, ""Non-GAAP"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release.

Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Program not to exceed $3,000,000,000. The maturities of the Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the Notes must be in minimum denominations of $250,000. The Notes will not be redeemable prior to maturity and will not be subject to voluntary prepayment.

The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the peer group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the modifier will be the average of the sum of all the modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the peer group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The Management Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. Since Mr. Kirkland has more than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 26, 2011 date of grant will vest upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules. Since Ms. Yarrington and Mr. Watson each have more than 75 points under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 26, 2011 date of grant will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of outstanding shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the grant date to the separation from service date, divided by 36) upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules.

276,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 09, 2011. On February 9, 2011, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal second quarter 2011 ended January 29, 2011. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Registrant excluded impairments and other charges for excess facilities. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued decisions that affected the tax treatment of share-based compensation expense for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While the Registrant was not a party to the case, as a result of the tax accounting change caused by each ruling, the Registrant recorded a tax benefit or charge in its financial statements during the applicable period. The Registrant excluded these items because they were unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

284,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2011. (b) On February 28, 2011, John E. Abele, our co-founder, notified our Chairman of the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") and our Secretary, and on March 1, 2011, notified our Board, of his intention not to stand for re-election at our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (our ""2011 Annual Meeting""). The Board subsequently approved the designation of Mr. Abele as Director Emeritus upon the expiration of his current term following the 2011 Annual Meeting. Ray J. Groves and Marye Anne Fox also notified our Chairman of the Board and our Secretary on February 28, 2011, and our Board on March 1, 2011, of their intention not to stand for re-election at our 2011 Annual Meeting and to retire from our Board effective at that time. (e) In 2010, we announced and began executing on the realignment of our management and business priorities through restructuring initiatives, our strategic plan and priority growth initiatives, which are designed to strengthen and position us for long-term success. Meanwhile, our performance in 2010 was affected by uncertain economic, regulatory and market conditions in the global environment as well as certain foreseen and other unforeseen events. As a result, certain of these strategic actions, restructuring and growth initiatives as well as certain unforeseen events not predictable under ordinary business conditions at the time our corporate and business goals were established under our 2010 Performance Incentive Plan (the ""PIP"") had a meaningful impact on our corporate and business funding units' actual performance as a percentage of plan for certain of their performance metrics. Based on a review of the nature of those specified events as well as their impact on each of our funding unit's performance as a percentage of plan for such metrics, our Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board (the ""Compensation Committee"") determined that targeted relief under the PIP was appropriate for the affected funding units because these events were unforeseen and not predictable under ordinary business conditions at the time our corporate and business goals were established under the PIP and were deemed not to be indicative of our on-going operating performance for purposes of the PIP. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion under the PIP to (i) grant relief for the identifiable direct impact of those specified events on our funding units, as applicable, (ii) establish a minimum funding of 50% for all affected funding units in an effort to provide relief for the indirect impact of those specified events on our funding units and (iii) establish a cap on each corporate funding metric at 100% of plan. As a result of the targeted relief and application of the funding cap, our corporate goals component of the PIP funded 94.79% (rather than 89.25%, the amount our corporate unit would have funded without the Compensation Committee's grant of relief), before application of the individual performance component of the PIP. The funding of our business goals under the PIP for the other funding units was impacted in varying degrees by the relief and application of the minimum funding level. The Compensation Committee approved the following cash incentive awards under the PIP to our named executive officers (""NEOs"") and principal financial officer as follows: NEO Title PIP Award Sam Leno Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer $501,344 Jeffrey D. Capello Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer $381,530 Timothy A. Pratt Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary $454,992 Stephen F. Moreci Executive Vice President, Global Sales Operations $253,710 Fredericus A. Colen Former Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer $152,030 The PIP award for J. Raymond Elliott, our President and Chief Executive Officer, was funded at the pre-relief funding level of 89.25% based upon his request and Compensation Committee approval. Pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Elliott elected to receive his PIP award in deferred stock units. Mr. Colen retired from the Company on June 30, 2010, and pursuant to his Agreement and General Release of All Claims, he was eligible to receive a PIP award pro-rated through June 30, 2010 measured against 50% corporate goals and 50% U.S. Cardiology, Rhythm and Vascular business unit goals. Messrs. Elliott, Leno, Capello and Pratt were measured against corporate goals and Mr. Moreci was measured against our former Endosurgery business unit goals for the first quarter and our corporate goals for the remainder of the year.

(the ""Board""), chair of the Finance Committee and a member of the Audit Committee, informed the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer that she will not stand for nomination for re-election at Dell's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Ms. Lewent will continue to serve as a director of Dell until Dell's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. (e) On March 3, 2011, the Board approved a grant under the Dell Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan to Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of 452,899 nonqualified stock options. On March 8, 2011, the Board approved a grant under the same plan to Michael S. Dell of an amount of performance-based restricted stock units equal in value to $7,500,000 with the number of units to be determined based on the final closing price of Dell's common stock on March 8, 2011 as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market. The option grant vests ratably over three years, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The restricted stock unit grant will vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date if the specified performance goals are attained. The stock options have a ten-year term and an exercise price of $15.73, which was the final closing price of Dell's common stock on March 3, 2011 as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Although the Board has not approved long-term incentives for Mr. Dell since Fiscal Year 2005, the Board believes it is important to offer Mr. Dell a compensation package that provides market competitive base salary, short-term and long-term incentives. On March 3, 2011, to reward Mr. Dell for his Fiscal Year 2011 performance, the Board approved discretionary bonus payouts to Mr. Dell of $3,385,000 comprised of a bonus payout of $2,635,000 in cash under the Dell Inc.

Change in Reportable Segment and Reclassifications As previously reported, beginning in fiscal 2011, Cisco Systems, Inc. (""Cisco"") combined its Asia Pacific and Japan operations in order to achieve operational efficiencies. As a result of this change, Cisco now organizes its business by the following four geographic segments: United States and Canada, European Markets, Emerging Markets, and Asia Pacific Markets. Accordingly, Cisco has reclassified the geographic segment data for prior periods to conform to this change. Pursuant to guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), Cisco has recast in Exhibit No. 99.1 filed with this Report the applicable items that were contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010 (the ""Form 10-K""), to reflect this change in reportable segments: Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" In addition to the change in geographic segments, Cisco has changed other items effective at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and has reclassified prior period information contained in Exhibit No. 99.1 to reflect the changes in these items. These items include the presentation of net product sales by groups of similar products and gross margin by geographic segment due to the refinement of these respective categories. Effective at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Cisco revised the categorization of certain of its products into a category called New Products. The New Products category replaces the prior category of Advanced Technologies and also includes certain products previously classified as Other Products. The New Products category consists of products related to collaboration, data center, security, wireless, and video connected home. The Other products category now consists primarily of optical networking products and emerging technologies. In addition, certain other immaterial reclassifications have been made to the prior year net sales amounts for Cisco's Routers and Switches product categories to conform to the current year's presentation. The information included in and with this Report is presented for information purposes only in connection with the change in our geographic segments and the other changes set forth herein. There is no change to Cisco's previously reported consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows contained in the Form 10-K. The changes to Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" and Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" reflect the reclassifications that have been made to Cisco's geographic segments and the other items referred to above. In the Item 1, ""Business,"" section of the Form 10-K, in the subsections titled ""General"" and ""Product and Services,"" Cisco refers to operating in five geographic segments, United States and Canada, European Markets, Emerging Markets, Asia Pacific, and Japan, and to organizing its product offerings into the following four categories: Routers, Switches, Advanced Technologies, and Other Products. In accordance with the changes discussed in the preceding paragraphs, effective at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2011, Cisco operates in four geographic segments, United States and Canada, European Markets, Emerging Markets, and Asia Pacific Markets, due to its combining its Asia Pacific and Japan operations. In addition, in accordance with the revised categorization of its product categories effective in the first fiscal quarter of 2011 described above, Cisco now organizes its product offerings into the following four categories: Routers, Switches, New Products, and Other Products.

308,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 20, 2011. On April 20, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the first quarter 2011. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, currency devaluations, legislative reforms, litigation reserves, acquired in-process research and development, restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.    (END) Dow Jones Newswires April 20, 2011 08:07 ET (12:07 GMT)",quarterly & annual financial report,"The filing includes Abbott Laboratories' results of operations for the first quarter of 2011, which is characteristic of a quarterly financial report."
309,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 20, 2011. On April 20, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as ""Non-GAAP."" Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2009, the Company included the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because it had previously occurred with relative frequency and was included in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2009 as the credit had been extended prior to the release of the fiscal 2009 business outlook. In fiscal 2011, however, the Company did not include the benefit of the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit in Non-GAAP results because the Company had not included the potential extension of the credit in its previously released fiscal 2011 business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit would be retroactively extended. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry. The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, ""Non-GAAP"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release.

On April 19, 2011, we concluded that we were required to record a goodwill impairment charge related to our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit in our results of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011. Based on market information that became available to us during the quarter, we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. CRM market, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Consequently, we performed an interim impairment test of our goodwill associated with the U.S. CRM reporting unit and recorded a $723 million estimated write-down of goodwill. The amount of the goodwill impairment charge is subject to finalization and is estimated to range between $650 million and $800 million. This non-cash impairment charge will not affect the debt covenants under our existing term loan and revolving credit facility agreements.

(the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal third quarter 2011 ended April 30, 2011. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation, and significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant effects of retroactive tax legislation. The Registrant is subject to changes in tax legislation which have retroactive effects. The Registrant excludes such significant effects of retroactive tax legislation because this item is unrelated to the Registrant's current ongoing business and operating results. Significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued decisions that affected the tax treatment of share-based compensation expense for the purpose of determining intangible development costs under a company's research and development cost sharing arrangement. While the Registrant was not a party to the case, as a result of the tax accounting change caused by each ruling, the Registrant recorded a tax benefit or charge in its financial statements during the applicable period. The Registrant excluded these items because they were unrelated to its current ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. The Registrant may be subject to significant effects of retroactive tax legislation to the extent that any such legislation becomes effective retroactively in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could experience significant transfer pricing adjustments related to share-based compensation to the extent that any court rulings or other guidance impacts this area in future periods.

334,ORCL,"       Oracle Corp. (ORCL) filed a Form 8K - Regulation FD Disclosure - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2011. Acquisition of Pillar Data Systems, Inc. On June 29, 2011, we agreed to acquire Pillar Data Systems, Inc., a company headquartered in San Jose, California, that develops and sells enterprise storage systems solutions (""Pillar Data""). Pillar Data is directly and indirectly majority-owned and controlled by Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle Corporation's Chief Executive Officer, director and largest stockholder. We entered into an agreement and plan of merger dated as of June 29, 2011 (the ""Merger Agreement""), with Panther Acquisition Corporation and Pillar Data, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Pillar Data in exchange for rights to receive contingent cash merger consideration, i.e. an ""earn-out,"" as described below and subject to certain conditions (the ""Earn-Out""). As a result, we will not make any upfront payments to Pillar Data or any Pillar Data stockholders, including Mr. Ellison, or option holders upon the closing of the acquisition. As of June 29, 2011, Pillar Data owed Mr. Ellison and his affiliates a total principal loan amount plus interest of approximately $544 million for amounts borrowed by Pillar Data in prior years (the ""Pillar Data Loan""). Immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition, the then outstanding amount of the Pillar Data Loan will be converted into shares of preferred stock of Pillar Data which will have a right to dividends accruing at an annual rate of 1.5%. Mr. Ellison directly and indirectly will also beneficially own 55% of the fully diluted shares of common stock of Pillar Data immediately prior to the closing. Upon closing of this acquisition, all of the common stock and stock options of Pillar Data will be cancelled in exchange for rights to receive a portion of the Earn-Out. Also upon closing, all of the preferred stock of Pillar Data will be cancelled in exchange for rights to receive a portion of the Earn-Out equal to the Pillar Data Loan plus an amount equal to the preferred stock dividends as if such dividends were to continue to accrue from the closing date through the date of payment of the Earn-Out. The preferred stock Earn-Out rights will have preference rights to the Earn-Out and will have priority over and be paid first before the other rights to the Earn-Out that result from the cancellation of the Pillar Data common stock and Pillar Data stock options. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Mr. Ellison and the other stockholders and the option holders of Pillar Data shall receive the Earn-Out, if any, on or before November 30, 2014 (assuming the transaction closes on or before August 31, 2011), which is 90 days following the completion of twelve (12) full fiscal quarters of Oracle Corporation (""Oracle"") following the closing date of this transaction (the ""Earn-Out Period""). The Earn-Out will be calculated based on a 3x multiple of certain future revenues of Pillar Data which will be reduced for certain future costs and other losses of Pillar Data. The Earn-Out is described in more detail below. Our obligation to pay the Earn-Out will be subject to reduction as a result of our right to set-off the amount of any indemnification claims we may have under the Merger Agreement. We do not expect the amount of the Earn-Out or its potential impact will be material to our results of operations or financial position. The Committee on Independence Issues of our Board of Directors (the ""Independence Committee""), which is comprised solely of independent directors in accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, led the negotiation of this transaction and reviewed the terms of this transaction as required by the Independence Committee's Charter and Oracle's Conflict of Interest Policy for Senior Officers. The Independence Committee engaged its own separate legal counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, and its own separate financial advisor, Perella Weinberg Partners LP (""PWP""), to advise it on this transaction. PWP provided the Independence Committee with a fairness opinion in connection with this transaction. The terms of this transaction were unanimously approved by the Independence Committee and, based upon the recommendation of the Independence Committee, by the independent members of Oracle's Board of Directors after the Independence Committee and the independent members of Oracle's Board of Directors concluded that such terms were fair to Oracle and determined that the transaction was in the best interests of Oracle and its stockholders. Mr. Ellison recused himself from the internal discussions and deliberations of the Independence Committee and of the other independent members of Oracle's Board of Directors regarding this transaction. The amount of any Earn-Out to be paid by us in the future will also be determined by the Independence Committee in its sole discretion absent any arithmetic error. As part of the terms of this transaction, the Independence Committee negotiated, among other things, that: (i) there is no duty for Oracle or the Independence Committee to ensure the Earn-Out will result in a payment to any Pillar Data stockholders and option holders, including Mr. Ellison; and (ii) the operation and management of the Pillar Data business during the Earn-Out Period will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Oracle with oversight from the Independence Committee. The Independence Committee plans to monitor the operation and management of the Pillar Data business and the progress of the Earn-Out during the Earn-Out Period. The closing of this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. This transaction's waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired on June 27, 2011. Description of Earn-Out The amount of the Earn-Out to be paid, if any, will equal: an amount (if positive) in cash equal to the product of (i) the difference between (x) the Net Revenues recognized by Oracle from the Pillar Data Axiom Products during only the last four (4) fiscal quarters of the Earn-Out Period (""Year 3 of the Earn-Out Period"") minus (y) the Net Losses (if any) during the entire Earn-Out Period, multiplied by (ii) three (3). The Earn-Out therefore will only be paid to Mr. Ellison, his affiliates and, if applicable, to the other Pillar Data stockholders and option holders if the Net Revenues during Year 3 of the Earn-Out Period exceed the Net Losses, if any, during the entire Earn-Out Period. Earn-Out Definitions ""Allocation Fraction"" means, for any given time period, the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount of net revenues of Oracle attributable to the sale of the Pillar Data Axiom Products recognized in accordance with GAAP and Oracle's accounting and revenue recognition practices for such time period by (ii) Oracle's total recognized revenues from its hardware systems products (including the Pillar Data Axiom Products) for such time period. ""Cost of Goods Sold"" means, for any given time period, the sum of (i) the product obtained by multiplying (a) Oracle's standard per unit costs of the Pillar Data Axiom Products sold during such time period, which such per unit costs include but are not limited to a standard materials and overhead allocation as determined pursuant to Oracle's standard inventory costing policies and processes for its hardware systems products by (b) the number of units of the Pillar Data Axiom Products sold during such time period, plus (ii) the product obtained by multiplying (y) other expenses and/or income, net, directly attributable to the manufacturing of Oracle's hardware systems products pursuant to Oracle's standard policies and processes, which such expenses and/or income include but are not limited to standard costing variances such as purchase price variances and overhead absorption variances that have not been included as a component of Oracle's standard per unit costs sold during such time period by (z) the Allocation Fraction for such time period. ""Deferred Revenue Adjustment"" means, for any given time period, the amount of net revenues of Oracle attributable to support and maintenance of the Pillar Data Axiom Products that are not recognized as net support revenues by Oracle in accordance with GAAP because such net support revenues have not been recorded as deferred revenue on Oracle's opening balance sheet for Pillar Data in accordance with GAAP purchase accounting requirements, but are recognized as net support revenues in accordance with Oracle's accounting practices for non-GAAP financial reporting purposes with respect to such time period. ...This item was truncated.

(""Cisco"") announced a workforce reduction plan. As part of the company's $1 billion annual operating expense reduction, Cisco will reduce its global workforce across all functions by approximately 6,500 employees, which includes approximately 2,100 employees who elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement program. This represents a reduction of approximately 9 percent of Cisco's regular full-time workforce. Impacted employees in the United States, Canada and select countries will be notified during the first week in August. The remainder of the global workforce reductions are expected to occur at a later date in compliance with local laws and regulations. In connection with this plan, Cisco estimates that it will recognize total pre-tax restructuring charges to its GAAP financial results in an amount not expected to exceed $1.3 billion over several quarters, consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits. Substantially all of these charges are cash-based. Cisco expects that approximately $750 million of these charges will be recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, including approximately $500 million relating to the voluntary early retirement program. The remaining balance of the charges is expected to be recognized during fiscal 2012. In connection with Cisco's continued implementation of its comprehensive action plan to simplify the organization, refine operations, and reduce annual operations expenses, it is anticipated that Cisco will recognize other restructuring charges to its GAAP financial results. These additional charges will be disclosed in earnings conference calls and in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The foregoing contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include the timing of reduction in force, the amount of related charges and Cisco's planned annual operating expense reduction. Statements regarding future events are based on Cisco's current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated risks related to the completion of the reduction in force in the manner anticipated by Cisco. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: Cisco's ability to implement the workforce reductions in various geographies; possible changes in the size and components of the expected costs and charges associated with the plan; and risks associated with Cisco's ability to achieve planned expense reductions.

In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, currency devaluations, legislative reforms, litigation reserves, acquired in-process research and development, tax audit settlements, restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

339,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2011. On July 20, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 26, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as ""Non-GAAP."" The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, ""Non-GAAP"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release. Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Non-GAAP information used by management, as presented in the attached press release, excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2011, the Company began excluding the benefit of retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. We believe this practice also conforms to the approach taken by many other leading technology companies. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

342,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 26, 2011. Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 On July 20, 2011, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Micron""), entered into a purchase agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative (the ""Representative"") of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the ""Initial Purchasers""), to issue and sell $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the ""2031A Notes"") and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the ""2031B Notes"" and together with the 2031A Notes, the ""Notes"") in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, Micron granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2031A Notes and up to an additional $45.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2031B Notes on the same terms and conditions to cover over-allotments, if any. On July 22, 2011, the Representative exercised this option in full. Micron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase the additional Notes, will be approximately $672.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. On July 26, 2011, Micron entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""Trustee""), relating to the 2031A Notes (the ""2031A Indenture"") and an indenture with the Trustee, relating to the 2031B Notes (the ""2031B Indenture"" and together with the 2031A Indenture, the ""Indentures""). The 2031A Indenture and the form of global note for the 2031A Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and the 2031B Indenture and the form of global note for the 2031B Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The 2031A Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year on the principal amount and the 2031B Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.875% per year on the principal amount, in each case accruing from July 26, 2011. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2012. The Notes will mature on August 1, 2031, subject to earlier conversion, redemption or repurchase. The initial conversion rate for the 2031A Notes is 105.2632 shares of Micron's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (""Common Stock""), per $1,000 principal amount of 2031A Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.50 per share of Common Stock. The initial conversion rate for the 2031B Notes is 105.2632 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2031B Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.50 per share of Common Stock. Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) if the Notes are called for redemption; (2) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after September 30, 2011, and only during such calendar quarter, if the closing price of Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price for the Notes per share of Common Stock, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (3) during the five business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of Common Stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (4) if specified distributions to holders of Common Stock are made or specified corporate events occur; or (5) at any time on or after May 1, 2031. Upon conversion, Micron will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted and cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at Micron's option, for the remainder, if any, of Micron's conversion obligations. If a holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control, as defined in the Indentures, Micron will, in certain circumstances, pay a make-whole premium by increasing the conversion rate for the Notes converted in connection with such make-whole change in control. Micron may not redeem the 2031A Notes prior to August 5, 2013 and may not redeem the 2031B Notes prior to August 5, 2014. On or after August 5, 2013, in the case of the 2031A Notes, and on or after August 5, 2014, in the case of the 2031B Notes, Micron may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the last reported sale price of Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to the date on which Micron provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Micron redeems the Notes prior to August 5, 2015, in the case of the 2031A Notes, or prior to August 5, 2016, in the case of the 2031B Notes, Micron will also make a ""make-whole premium"" payment in cash equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest on the Notes to be redeemed through August 5, 2015, in the case of the 2031A Notes, or through August 5, 2016, in the case of the 2031B Notes. The present value of the remaining interest payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to 150 basis points. On or after August 5, 2015, in the case of the 2031A Notes, and on or after August 5, 2016, in the case of the 2031B Notes, Micron may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. On August 1, 2018, with respect to the 2031A Notes, and on August 1, 2020, with respect to the 2031B Notes, the holders may require Micron to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Upon a change in control or a termination of trading, as defined in the Indenture, the holders may require Micron to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Notes are Micron's general, unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of Micron's existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the assets securing such debt, and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Micron's subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Indentures do not limit the amount of indebtedness that Micron or any of its subsidiaries may incur. ...This item was truncated.

346,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Exit or Disposal Activities - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 26, 2011. On July 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved, and the Company committed to, a 2011 restructuring program (the ""Program""), designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. The Company estimates that the Program will reduce annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including priority growth initiatives and emerging markets initiatives. Key activities under the Program, of which the Company's Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Initiative and components of the Emerging Markets Initiative (EMI) are a part, include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; and leveraging preferred vendors. Among these efforts, the Company is expanding its ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action will enable Boston Scientific to grow its global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, Boston Scientific is undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to its key business strategies. These activities will start to be initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013. The Company anticipates the reduction of 1,200 to 1,400 positions worldwide through a combination of employee attrition and targeted headcount reductions as the Program is implemented. Plans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, and the Company will consult in due course with relevant employee representative bodies, where required under local laws. The Company estimates that the implementation of the Program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million to $210 million, and that approximately $150 million to $200 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. The following table provides a summary of the Company's estimates of costs associated with the Program by major type of cost: Type of cost Total estimated amount expected to be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $125 million to $150 million Other (1) $20 million to $40 million Restructuring-related expenses: Other (2) $10 million to $20 million $155 million to $210 million (1) Consists primarily of consultant fees and contractual cancellations. (2) Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, retention and infrastructure-related costs. The Company estimates that during the third quarter of 2011, it will record approximately $10 million of restructuring charges associated with the Program. The Company will record the remaining expenses throughout the duration of the Program when it identifies with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated and as other Program-related expenses are incurred.

The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing.

These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may be subject to changes in tax legislation, court decisions, or tax settlements, that affect one or more prior fiscal years. The Registrant excludes the tax charges or benefits of these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

355,DELL,"       Dell Inc. (DELL) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 10, 2011. Dell Inc. (""Dell""), a Delaware corporation, is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to describe the material terms of its common stock under Delaware corporate law and under Dell's restated certificate of incorporation (the ""charter"") and amended and restated bylaws (the ""bylaws"") as in effect on the date of this report. The following description updates the description of Dell's common stock set forth in its registration statement on Form 8-A filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Dell's charter and bylaws as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). As previously reported, Dell's charter and bylaws were most recently amended on August 16, 2010. Authorized Capital Stock Dell's charter authorizes a total of 7,005,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 7,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share (the ""common stock""), and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share (the ""preferred stock""). As of the date of this report, no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Description of Common Stock Voting Rights. Each holder of the common stock is entitled to cast one vote for each share of common stock held by such holder upon any matter which is properly considered and acted upon by common stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders. Unless otherwise required by law or provided for in the charter or bylaws, the presence, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote on any matter will constitute a quorum for the purpose of considering such matter at a meeting of stockholders. Except in certain circumstances in the election of directors (as described below), when a quorum is present at any stockholder meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on any matter is necessary to approve the matter, unless the matter is one upon which a different vote is required by law or provided for in the charter or bylaws. As of the date of this report, there are no provisions of the charter or bylaws that require a different percentage for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum or approval of any matter at a meeting of stockholders. If the number of director nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected at an annual meeting of stockholders, directors will be elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote for the election of directors. If the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting, directors instead will be elected by a plurality vote of the stockholders entitled to vote for the election of directors. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Dell,whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the common stock will be entitled to receive ratably any or all assets remaining to be paid or distributed after the payment or provision for payment of Dell's debts and other liabilities and the payment or setting aside for payment of any preferential amount due to the holders of any other class or series of Dell stock. Dividends. Subject to the provisions of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the board of directors may, in its discretion, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, declare and pay dividends on the common stock on an equal per-share basis. No dividend (other than a dividend in capital stock ranking on parity with the common stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares with respect to such a stock dividend) may be declared or paid on any share or shares of any class of Dell stock or series thereof ranking on a parity with the common stock in respect of payment of dividends for any dividend period unless the board of directors shall have declared, for the same dividend period, like proportionate dividends on all outstanding shares of common stock. Absence of Other Rights. Holders of the common stock do not have any preemptive, cumulative voting, subscription, conversion, redemption or sinking fund rights. Anti-Takeover Effects of Charter and Bylaw Provisions The charter and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control of Dell. Charter Provisions. Provisions of our charter that could have anti-takeover effects, among other matters: provide that a director may be removed from office by a vote of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares only for ""cause"" (as defined in the charter); provide that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office or by the sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders; prohibit the stockholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting with respect to any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders at any annual or special meeting; and as described below under ""Preferred Stock,"" provide authority for the board of directors without stockholder approval to provide for the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of the preferred stock, in one or more series, with terms and conditions, and having rights, privileges and preferences, to be determined by the board of directors. Bylaw Provisions. Provisions of our bylaws that could have anti-takeover effects, among other matters (and in addition to provisions also contained in our charter as summarized above): provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by Dell's chairman of the board, by a majority of the authorized number of directors, or by Dell's chief executive officer, president or secretary upon the written request, stating the purpose or purposes of the meeting, signed by the holders of at least 50% of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote at the meeting; and as described below, establish advance notice procedures for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to present any other business for consideration at any annual or special meeting of stockholders. Under Dell's bylaws, a stockholder must comply with specific notice requirements if the stockholder wishes to (1) nominate a person for election to the board of directors at any meeting of stockholders or (2) bring business before the stockholders at any annual meeting of stockholders which is not included in Dell's proxy statement. The stockholder must provide written notice to Dell's corporate secretary of an intent to nominate a director or directors not later than (1) with respect to an election of directors to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders, 60 days in advance of such meeting, and (2) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to stockholders. The notice must provide the following information: the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of Dell stock entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder, each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the SEC's proxy rules, if the nominee had been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the board of directors; and the consent of each nominee to serve as a director if elected. ...This item was truncated.

362,CVS,"       CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 24, 2011. As previously disclosed, on August 23, 2011, the Board of Directors of CVS Caremark Corporation (the ""Corporation"") approved a share repurchase program (the ""2011 Repurchase Program"") for up to $4.0 billion of its outstanding common stock.

The seller makes initial deliveries of shares to the Corporation shortly after execution of the transaction, and may deliver additional shares to the Corporation at or prior to maturity of the transaction.

366,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on September 07, 2011. On September 7, 2011 we received a Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claiming that we owe additional net taxes of $154 million, plus interest based on an audit of the 2006 and 2007 tax years of Boston Scientific Corporation. We previously disclosed in our public filings our expectation that we would not be able to resolve our tax liability for this period through applicable IRS administrative procedures and, in our most recent public filing, we disclosed the July 2011 receipt of an IRS Revenue Agent's Report for this period. This Notice of Deficiency is materially consistent with the July 2011 Revenue Agent's Report. We intend to file a timely petition to the U.S. Tax Court contesting this assessment. The $154 million net assessment for the Company's 2006 and 2007 tax years relates to transfer pricing adjustments proposed by the IRS that would result in incremental tax of $283 million offset in part by an unrelated agreed refund of $129 million. The adjustments proposed by the IRS are based on positions substantially similar to those currently subject to our U.S. Tax Court proceedings for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years of Guidant Corporation. The primary issue under dispute for all of these years is the intercompany transfer pricing in connection with technology license agreements between certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant, which we acquired in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment. We believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations, and that the previously reported income tax for the years in question is appropriate. No payments on the assessment would be required, nor will the refund be processed, until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with this matter are adequate and that the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, both the final resolution and potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like ""anticipate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""believe,"" ""plan,"" ""estimate,"" ""intend"" and similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's beliefs, assumptions and estimates using information available to the Company at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our opinions with respect to: the strength of our tax position with respect to this matter, the final resolution of this matter and expected timing thereof, the adequacy of tax reserves for this matter; and our financial performance. If the Company's underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by the Company's forward-looking statements. These factors, in some cases, have affected and in the future (together with other factors) could affect the Company's ability to implement our business strategy and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed in this Current Report. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, among other things: future economic, competitive, reimbursement and regulatory conditions; new product introductions; demographic trends; intellectual property litigation; closing of announced acquisitions, divestitures and related transitions; our restructuring initiatives; financial market conditions; and future business decisions made by the Company and our competitors. All of these factors are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of them are beyond the Company's control. For a further list and description of these and other important risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company's future operations, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which the Company may update in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q the Company has filed or will file hereafter. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which those expectations may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items.

388,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 02, 2011. On November 2, 2011, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 25, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as ""Non-GAAP."" The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, ""Non-GAAP"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release. Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation related to stock options is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. In fiscal 2011, the Company began excluding the benefit of retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

392,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 09, 2011. On November 9, 2011, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal first quarter 2012 ended October 29, 2011. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may be subject to changes in tax legislation, court decisions, or tax settlements, that affect one or more prior fiscal years. The Registrant excludes the tax charges or benefits of these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

In addition, a discussion of Dell management's reasons for including the non-GAAP financial measures, the material limitations associated with the use of the non-GAAP financial measures, and the manner in which Dell management compensates for those limitations is included under ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" in Exhibit 99.1. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, and earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

399,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 01, 2011. On December 1, 2011, we received a Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claiming that we owe additional net taxes of $581 million, plus interest and penalties, based on an audit of the 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax years of Guidant Corporation and its subsidiaries as they existed in that time period. We previously disclosed in our public filings the February 2011 receipt of an IRS Revenue Agent's Report for these years and our expectation that we would not be able to resolve our tax liability for these years through applicable IRS administrative procedures. This Notice of Deficiency is materially consistent with the February 2011 Revenue Agent's Report. The incremental tax liability primarily relates to proposed adjustments to Guidant's intercompany transfer pricing in connection with technology license agreements between certain of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries and to the financial terms of our transaction agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. The proposed IRS adjustments are based on positions substantially similar to those currently subject to our U.S. Tax Court proceedings for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years of Guidant and the 2006 and 2007 tax years of Boston Scientific. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott. We intend to file a timely petition to the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS assessment. We believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations, and that the previously reported income tax for the years in question is appropriate. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and that the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, both the final resolution and potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The performance share awards granted under these plans are a component of the overall mix of our long-term incentive program, and will represent a greater percentage of that mix for 2012. Under both plans, performance share awards will be granted to our executive officers and certain members of our senior management team in the form of deferred stock units issued under our 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan which was previously approved by our stockholders. (A) 2012 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Plan The purpose of the 2012 TSR PSP is to align our executive compensation program with the interests of shareholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by comparing the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of our common stock to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2012 and ending on December 31, 2014 (the Performance Period). Under the 2012 TSR PSP, the TSR for Boston Scientific and such other companies will be measured in three annual performance cycles over the Performance Period. At the end of the Performance Period, the final TSR will be calculated using the simple average of the TSR for the three annual performance cycles. Performance share awards will vest only upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria set forth in the 2012 TSR PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. A copy of the 2012 TSR PSP is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2012 TSR PSP. (B) 2012 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Plan The purpose of the 2012 FCF PSP is to align our executive compensation program with the interests of shareholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by providing incentives for the achievement of key business performance objectives critical to our success. Under the 2012 FCF PSP, performance will be measured by comparing our actual free cash flow for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2012 and ending on December 31, 2012 against our 2012 financial plan performance for free cash flow. Performance share awards will only vest upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria (which include a three-year service period) set forth in the 2012 FCF PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. A copy of the 2012 FCF PSP is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2012 FCF PSP. (ii) Severance Plans (A) Boston Scientific Corporation Severance Pay and Layoff Notification Plan as Amended and Restated On December 12, 2011, our Compensation Committee approved the Boston Scientific Corporation Severance Pay and Layoff Notification Plan as Amended and Restated (the Bridge Plan). The Bridge Plan restates our existing Boston Scientific Corporation Severance Pay and Layoff Notification Plan (the Prior Plan) as of January 1, 2012. The purpose of the Bridge Plan is to provide, under certain circumstances, severance benefits to eligible United States employees (including executive officers) hired prior to January 1, 2012 who receive notice of involuntary termination of their employment due to a Layoff (as such term is defined in the Bridge Plan) during the two-year period starting January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2013. The Prior Plan will remain in effect for eligible employees who receive notice of involuntary termination of their employment due to a Layoff (as such term is defined in the Prior Plan) on or before December 31, 2011. The severance benefits available under the Bridge Plan for eligible employees meeting plan conditions generally include (a) severance pay, (b) outplacement services and (c) subsidized COBRA continuation of health coverage, all for a specified period of time following termination (the amount and duration of which are calculated based on position classification, Pay and Years of Service - as such terms as defined in the Bridge Plan). The payment of severance pay and a portion of the outplacement services above a certain amount are subject to the receipt of a release of claims. The material changes from the Prior Plan include the payment of a lump sum instead of pay continuation for the relevant period and certain pro-rated bonus payments will not be available to eligible employees unless they are employed in a bonus-eligible position for at least nine months in a given year and their termination is due to a Layoff (as such term is defined in the Bridge Plan). A copy of the Bridge Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bridge Plan. (B) Boston Scientific Corporation U.S. Severance Plan for Exempt Employees On December 13, 2011, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the adoption of the Boston Scientific Corporation U.S. Severance Plan for Exempt Employees (the Exempt Plan) effective as of January 1, 2012.

The severance benefits under the Exempt Plan for eligible employees meeting plan conditions generally include (a) severance pay, (b) outplacement services and (c) subsidized COBRA continuation of health coverage, all for a specified period of time following termination (the amount and duration of which are calculated based on position classification, Pay and Years of Service - as such terms as defined in the Exempt Plan The payment of severance pay and a portion of the outplacement services above a certain amount are subject to the receipt of a release of claims. A copy of the Exempt Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

422,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 25, 2012. (e) On January 25, 2012, the independent Directors of the Chevron Board of Directors approved the grant of 420,000 stock options and 66,000 performance shares to J.S. Watson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and ratified the following grants by the Management Compensation Committee under the Long Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (""LTIP""): G.L. Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, 175,000 stock options and 27,500 performance shares; R.H. Pate, Vice President and General Counsel, 78,000 stock options and 12,000 performance shares; M.K. Wirth, Executive Vice President, 105,000 stock options and 17,000 performance shares; and P.E. Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 105,000 stock options and 17,000 performance shares. The stock options have a ten year term, and one-third of the grant vests at each anniversary of the date of grant, except as described below in the last paragraph. The exercise price for the stock options is $107.73 per share, which is based on the closing price of Chevron's common stock on January 25, 2012, the date of grant. The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (TSR) for the performance period as compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group (BP p.l.c., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c. and Total S.A.). The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the peer group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the modifier will be the average of the sum of all the modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the peer group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The Management Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. Since Mr. Kirkland has more than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 25, 2012 date of grant will vest upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules. Since Ms. Yarrington, Mr. Watson and Mr. Wirth each has more than 75 points but less than 90 points under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 25, 2012 date of grant will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the options grant date (or, for performance shares, the performance period start date) to the separation from service date, up to 36 months, divided by 36 months) upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules.

423,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 01, 2012. On February 1, 2012, QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm"" or the ""Company"") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended December 25, 2011. A copy of that press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The attached press release presents certain financial information that is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); such information is referred to as ""Non-GAAP."" The Non-GAAP financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, ""Non-GAAP"" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented in the attached press release. Non-GAAP financial information is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless & Internet segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments. Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but that were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings. However, the Company excludes any benefit resulting from the retroactive extensions of the federal R&D tax credit from Non-GAAP results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the federal R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as any tax effects of restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. These certain acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating businesses. The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.

427,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 08, 2012. On February 8, 2012, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal second quarter 2012 ended January 28, 2012. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may be subject to changes in tax legislation, court decisions, or tax settlements, that affect one or more prior fiscal years. The Registrant excludes the tax charges or benefits of these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

At this time, Cisco has not borrowed any funds under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement will be based on either (i) the higher of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America's ""prime rate"" as announced from time to time or (c) the London interbank offered rate (""LIBOR"") for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on Cisco's senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Cisco will pay an annual commitment fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which may vary depending on Cisco's credit ratings. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of liens and secured indebtedness, and limitations on incurrence of any indebtedness by Cisco's subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that Cisco maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.

436,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2012. Overview On February 28, 2012, Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron"") entered into agreements with Intel Corporation (""Intel""), with certain subsidiaries of Micron and Intel, with IM Flash Singapore LLP, a joint venture through which subsidiaries of Micron and Intel currently manufacture NAND flash memory products in Singapore (""IMFS""), and with IM Flash Technologies, LLC, a joint venture through which Micron and Intel currently manufacture NAND flash memory products in the United States (""IMFT""). These agreements provide for, among other things, (a) the extension of the term of the IMFT joint venture and the expansion of the scope of that joint venture to also include certain emerging memory technologies, (b) the purchase by Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron (""Micron Singapore""), of the business of IMFS, (c) the purchase by Micron of the assets of IMFT located at IMFT's manufacturing operations in Manassas, Virginia (""MTV""), and (d) the amendment or termination of certain existing agreements relating to IMFT and IMFS. In connection with the purchase transactions described above, Micron and Micron Singapore expect to pay a purchase price of approximately $600 million net of distributions received by Micron and Micron Singapore from IMFT and IMFS, which amount approximates the book value of the related acquired assets. The parties will continue to share output of IMFT and certain research and development costs generally in proportion to their respective investments in IMFT. The IMFS supply agreements with subsidiaries of Micron and Intel will be terminated, and Micron and a subsidiary of Micron will enter into new agreements to supply NAND flash memory products and certain emerging technology memory products to Intel. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by these agreements is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Set forth below are brief descriptions of the material agreements related to the transactions. Master Agreement Micron and Micron Singapore entered into a Master Agreement (the ""Master Agreement"") with Intel, Intel Technology Asia Pte. Ltd (""Intel Technology""), IMFT and IMFS, which contemplate the agreements described above, that certain other agreements among the parties will be executed (the ""Transactions"") and that certain actions will be taken with respect to existing agreements among the parties, including the (a) amendment of the limited liability company operating agreement of IMFT (the ""Operating Agreement""), (b) amendments to supply agreements between IMFT and each of Micron and Intel, (c) execution of new supply agreements among Micron, a subsidiary of Micron and Intel, (d) termination of the existing supply agreements between IMFS and subsidiaries of each of Micron and Intel, (e) termination of the existing lease for the MTV facility, and (f) extension of certain licensed intellectual property rights. In addition, Intel Technology will resign as a partner in IMFS. The Master Agreement also provides that upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that agreement, IMFS and IMFT will each make a special distribution to its members, consisting of the proceeds received by IMFS and IMFT in connection with the IMFS Business Sale Agreement and the MTV Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, each as described below. Micron Singapore and Intel Technology will amend the limited liability partnership agreement of IMFS (the ""LLPA"") to conform the rights and obligations of the parties under the LLPA to their rights and obligations under the Master Agreement. Micron and Intel also amended a prior master agreement related to the formation of IMFT entered into in 2005 to remove provisions that are no longer relevant. IMFS Business Sale Agreement Under the IMFS Business Sale Agreement (the ""IMFS BSA""), Micron Singapore will purchase the business of IMFS as a going concern (including by purchasing substantially all of the assets and assuming substantially all of the liabilities of IMFS), will pay an amount in cash that is at least equal to the fair market value of the IMFS premises (as previously determined by an appointed third party valuation professional) (the ""IMFS Cash Amount"") and will pay an additional amount in the form of a promissory note. The amount of the promissory note will reflect the balance of the net book value (subject to certain adjustments) of the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the IMFS business at the time the transaction is consummated after subtracting the IMFS Cash Amount. The transactions contemplated by the IMFS BSA are subject to certain Singapore regulatory approvals and waivers relating to the transfer of the IMFS business, including approvals from the Jurong Town Corporation relating to the sale of the IMFS premises, and other customary closing conditions. MTV Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement The Master Agreement provides that Micron and IMFT will enter into the MTV Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (the ""MTV PSA""). The MTV PSA provides that Micron will purchase substantially all of the assets of IMFT related to MTV, will assume substantially all of the liabilities of IMFT related to MTV and will pay an amount in cash that is equal to the net book value (subject to certain adjustments) of such purchased assets and assumed liabilities. IMFT Operating Agreement The Master Agreement provides that Micron and Intel will enter into an amended Operating Agreement of IMFT. The amendments to the Operating Agreement will provide that, subject to certain conditions, Micron over time will contribute to IMFT up to an additional US$178.5 million in cash and Intel over time will contribute to IMFT up to an additional US$171.5 million in cash. The amended Operating Agreement also will provide that IMFT may manufacture certain emerging memory products in addition to NAND flash memory. The amended Operating Agreement also will extend the term of IMFT to December 31, 2024, unless earlier terminated as provided therein. The amended Operating Agreement provides that, in the event of dissolution, IMFT's assets will be auctioned off under a sealed bid process, in which both parties may participate. The amended Operating Agreement provides for certain buy-sell rights, commencing in 2015, pursuant to which Intel may elect to sell to Micron, or Micron may elect to purchase from Intel, Intel's interest in IMFT. If Intel so elects, Micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from Intel for one to two years. Supply Agreements Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement, IMFT will enter separate amendments to the existing supply agreements with Micron and Intel. The amended supply agreements will provide for IMFT to sell each party both NAND and certain other memory products. The Micron and Intel supply agreements are identical to each other in all material respects except that the percentage of output to be purchased by Micron and Intel will be generally consistent with each party's investment in IMFT. Upon the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement, Micron and a subsidiary of Micron will enter into two new supply agreements with Intel pursuant to which Micron will sell certain memory products to Intel. Pricing under these supply agreements will be determined on a cost-plus basis. In connection with one of these supply agreements, and upon the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement, Intel will deposit US$300 million with Micron pursuant to a deposit agreement. Such deposit may, and if and to the extent directed by Intel will, be applied to the supply of products to Intel from Micron, and will be refunded in certain circumstances.

437,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Regulation FD Disclosure - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2012. On February 28, 2012, Micron issued a press release announcing the update of its joint venture with Intel. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. The foregoing discussion contains forward-looking statements regarding existing and future investments in IMFT and certain emerging memory technologies. Although Micron believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, Micron cannot guarantee the future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of Micron, Micron's subsidiaries, IMFT or the technologies it works to develop. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to vary are changes in Micron's and Intel's ability and commitment to contribute cash to IMFT; the demand for and market acceptance of products Micron and Intel manufacture and have manufactured by and purchase from IMFT; the demand for and market acceptance of products Micron has manufactured by and purchased from IMFS; pricing pressures and actions taken by competitors; the ability to obtain regulatory approvals related to the purchase of IMFS; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp, and manufacturing yields, at IMFT's production facilities of new emerging memory products as well as the continued operations and manufacturing yields of NAND flash memory production; disruptions in the supply of necessary raw materials, utilities or other infrastructure; unexpected expenses related to manufacturing operations; the ability of Intel and Micron to integrate technology, management and operations at IMFT and at the facilities that it uses; adverse effects associated with product defects and deviations from published specifications; and litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, antitrust and other issues.

The changes to the 2012 Annual Bonus Plan implemented by the amendment include, among others, the following: * there will be a single bonus pool (the Total Annual Bonus) that will be based on the Company's performance measured against achievement of corporate-level performance metric goals for adjusted earnings per share and global sales on a constant currency basis (Global sales) rather than based on each participating unit's (as defined below) performance measured against achievement of that unit's performance metric goals. The Total Annual Bonus will be in lieu of separate bonus pools for corporate, global operations and each participating business, regional and country unit (each, a participating unit); * the Total Annual Bonus Pool (i) will, for 2012, be capped at 95% of the aggregate annual bonus pool target (the Aggregate Annual Target) in the event that the performance for Global sales is below 95% of our approved performance goal for that metric; and (ii) will have a ceiling of 150% and a floor of 50% of the Aggregate Annual Target, with retained ability of our Board to terminate, suspend or modify the plan and to reduce the Total Annual Bonus based on the Company's performance relative to our quality objectives and performance of our quality systems; * the Total Annual Bonus will be allocated among all of the participating units based on each participating unit's overall and relative performance measured against its achievement of that unit's predetermined ""Scorecard"" performance metrics and goals and taking into consideration, as appropriate, other factors; such allocation will be a percentage of the annual bonus pool target for each participating unit (representing the total target annual bonuses of all eligible employees for the year within that unit) (each such allocated amount, an Assigned Bonus Pool); and * the Assigned Bonus Pool for each participating unit will then be allocated among all managers of plan participants within that participating unit. Such managers will then evaluate the performance of the participants under their management and determine, for each participant, the percentage (between 0% and 200%) of the participant's target annual bonus that will be used to determine the participant's bonus award.

441,GM,"       General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2012. Master Agreement On February 29, 2012, General Motors Holdings LLC (""GMH""), a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors Company (the ""Company""), signed a Master Agreement, dated as of February 29, 2012 (the ""Master Agreement"") with Peugeot S.A. (""PSA""). Under the terms of the Master Agreement, GMH and PSA have created a long-term and broad-scale global strategic alliance. The Master Agreement provides that the parties will enter into agreements to share joint development of vehicle platforms, components and modules as well as work towards the creation of a global purchasing joint venture for the sourcing of commodities, components and other goods and services from suppliers. GMH also intends to establish a strategic, commercial cooperation with Gefco, an integrated logistics services company and subsidiary of PSA whereby Gefco would provide logistics services to GM in Europe and Russia. The Master Agreement also provides that concurrently with the execution of the Master Agreement, GMH will enter into various agreements, as described below, pursuant to which GMH will acquire 7 percent of PSA's issued share capital for approximately 320 million based on PSA's current market capitalization (""Equity Contribution""). The initial term of the alliance is 10 years with automatic renewal periods of three years subject to written-non renewal notice by either party. The alliance will be governed by a steering committee that includes senior leader representatives from both GMH and PSA. The implementation of the strategic alliance contemplated under the Master Agreement is subject to certain conditions including any required antitrust clearance by certain jurisdictions, implementation of the Equity Contribution, and the execution of various ancillary agreements. A joint News Release dated February 29, 2012, and an investor and media slide deck dated February 29, 2012 which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference, contain additional information with respect to the Master Agreement and the alliance. Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement On February 29, 2012, GMH signed a Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 29, 2012 (the ""Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement"") by and among GMH, tablissements Peugeot Fr res (""EPF"") and Soci t Fonci re, Financi re et de Participations (""FFP""). Concurrently with the signing of the Master Agreement, PSA is increasing its share capital by approximately 1 billion through a share capital increase (the ""Capital Increase"") with preferential subscription rights (the ""Subscription Rights""). Under the terms of the Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement, GMH will purchase from EPF and FFP Subscription Rights which EPF and FFP will not be exercising. Pursuant to the Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement, the price for the Subscription Rights GMH will purchase from EPF and FFP is expected to be the theoretical Subscription Rights value set at the launch of the Rights Offering. The purchase of the Subscription Rights by GMH is subject to several conditions including the issuance by PSA of the Subscription Rights and the completion of the Capital Increase. Under this agreement GMH has also agreed to exercise the Subscription Rights and subscribe for the appropriate amount of new PSA shares (the ""Rights Purchase Shares""). The price GMH will pay for these Rights Purchase Shares is the subscription price set by PSA at the launch of their rights offering. Share Purchase Agreement On February 29, 2012, GMH signed a Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 29, 2012 (the ""Share Purchase Agreement"") with PSA. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, GMH agreed to purchase from PSA treasury shares totaling the difference between the number of shares representing 7 percent of the PSA share capital after the Capital Increase and the number of shares subscribed by GMH by exercising the Subscription Rights it will acquire from EFP and FFP pursuant to the Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement (the ""Treasury Shares""). Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the price for the Treasury Shares is expected to be the theoretical price for PSA shares after the rights offering as calculated on the day of the Capital Increase launch, such amount would include the effect of dilution of current shares outstanding offset by the increase in capital resulting from proceeds of the rights offering. The sale of the Treasury Shares to GMH is subject to several closing conditions including the subscription by GMH to the Rights Purchase Shares and the completion of the Capital Increase. The foregoing descriptions of the Master Agreement, the Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the provisions of the Master Agreement, the Subscription Rights Purchase Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement, each of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively.

449,GM,"       General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Changes to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on March 20, 2012. On March 20, 2012 the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of General Motors Company (the ""Company"") amended paragraph (d) of Section 2.2 of the Company's bylaws effective immediately. Section 2.2 deals with director elections, and paragraph (c) provides that in an election for the Board, a majority of the votes cast with regard to a candidate must be affirmative for him to be elected a director. Prior to the amendment, Paragraph (d), ""Contested Elections,"" established an exception to majority voting by permitting election by a plurality of votes cast if a stockholder gives notice that he intends to nominate one or more candidates at a stockholder meeting, does not withdraw his notice at least 14 days before the Company begins mailing the meeting notice, and has not nominated a candidate within the past 18 months who received less than 0.01 percent of the votes cast. As amended, paragraph (d) still provides for plurality voting when notice of intent to make nominations at an upcoming meeting has been received and has not been withdrawn, but gives the Board some discretion to retain majority voting, since under the amended provision plurality voting will apply unless the Board determines in its reasonable judgment that the nominees are likely to receive less than 0.01 percent of the votes cast at the meeting. This amendment is intended to strengthen the Company's policy favoring majority voting for directors by permitting the Board to prevent the switch to plurality voting under these circumstances. The description above of the amendments to the Company's bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of paragraph (d) of section 2.2 as amended, set forth in Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated in this Item by reference.

454,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Changes to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2012. (a) On March 28, 2012, the Board amended Article VII of the By-Laws of Chevron (""By-Law Amendment""), effective on that date. Article VII, which the board originally adopted on September 29, 2010, designated the Delaware Court of Chancery as the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative litigation brought on behalf of the company, (ii) any litigation concerning the fiduciary duties of the company's officers and directors, (iii) any litigation arising out of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any other litigation involving claims concerning Chevron's internal affairs. The original by-law was designed to save Chevron and its stockholders from the increased expense of defending against duplicative litigation brought in multiple courts, and also to provide that claims involving Delaware law are decided by Delaware Courts. The By-Law Amendment is consistent with this purpose and serves to clarify and refine two aspects of Article VII. First, the By-Law Amendment makes clear that the forum for such litigation includes any state or federal court in the State of Delaware, rather than just the Delaware Court of Chancery, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the by-law in light of the Court of Chancery's jurisdictional limitations. Second, the By-Law Amendment makes clear that Article VII will not apply where the Delaware courts cannot obtain personal jurisdiction over an indispensible party named as a defendant, so that stockholders retain the right to sue outside of Delaware when a case does not involve Delaware law and/or jurisdiction cannot be obtained in Delaware. Additional Information and Where to Find It This Current Report on Form 8-K may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the solicitation of proxies from stockholders for Chevron's 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ""Annual Meeting""). Chevron will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and make available to its stockholders a proxy statement containing information about Chevron and the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. CHEVRON STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT CHEVRON WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. Chevron stockholders will also be able to obtain the proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about Chevron, without charge at the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov) and at Chevron's website (http://www.chevron.com).

In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items.

467,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 12, 2012. Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 On April 12, 2012, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Micron""), entered into a purchase agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, as representatives (the ""Representatives"") of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the ""Initial Purchasers""), to issue and sell $480.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the ""2032C Notes"") and $390.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the ""2032D Notes"" and together with the 2032C Notes, the ""Notes"") in the United States and Canada to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, Micron granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2032C Notes and up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2032D Notes on the same terms and conditions to cover over-allotments, if any. On April 17, 2012, the Representatives exercised this option in full. Micron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase the additional Notes, will be approximately $979 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. On April 18, 2012, Micron entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""Trustee""), relating to the 2032C Notes (the ""2032C Indenture"") and an indenture with the Trustee, relating to the 2032D Notes (the ""2032D Indenture"" and together with the 2032C Indenture, the ""Indentures""). The 2032C Indenture and the form of global note for the 2032C Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and the 2032D Indenture and the form of global note for the 2032D Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The 2032C Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.375% per year on the principal amount and the 2032D Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per year on the principal amount, in each case accruing from April 18, 2012. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears in cash on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2012. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2032, subject to earlier conversion, redemption or repurchase. The initial conversion rate for the 2032C Notes is 103.8907 shares of Micron's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (""Common Stock""), per $1,000 principal amount of 2032C Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.63 per share of Common Stock. The initial conversion rate for the 2032D Notes is 100.1803 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2032D Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.98 per share of Common Stock. Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) if the Notes are called for redemption; (2) during any calendar quarter commencing at any time after May 31, 2012, and only during such calendar quarter, if the closing price of Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price for the Notes per share of Common Stock, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (3) during the five business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of Common Stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the Notes; (4) if specified distributions to holders of Common Stock are made or specified corporate events occur; or (5) at any time on or after February 1, 2032. Upon conversion, Micron will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at Micron's option, in each case based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in the 20 trading-day observation period. If a holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control, as defined in the Indentures, Micron will, in certain circumstances, pay a make-whole premium by increasing the conversion rate for the Notes converted in connection with such make-whole change in control. Micron may not redeem the 2032C Notes prior to May 1, 2016 and may not redeem the 2032D Notes prior to May 1, 2017. On or after May 1, 2016, in the case of the 2032C Notes, and on or after May 1, 2017, in the case of the 2032D Notes, Micron may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the volume weighted average price of Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for such series of notes for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to the date on which Micron provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Micron redeems the Notes prior to May 4, 2019, in the case of the 2032C Notes, or prior to May 4, 2021, in the case of the 2032D Notes, Micron will also make a ""make-whole premium"" payment in cash equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest on the Notes to be redeemed through May 4, 2019, in the case of the 2032C Notes, or through May 4, 2021, in the case of the 2032D Notes. The present value of the remaining interest payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to 150 basis points. On or after May 4, 2019, in the case of the 2032C Notes, and on or after May 4, 2021, in the case of the 2032D Notes, Micron may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. On May 1, 2019, with respect to the 2032C Notes, and on May 1, 2021, with respect to the 2032D Notes, the holders may require Micron to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Upon a change in control or a termination of trading, as defined in the Indenture, the holders may require Micron to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Notes are Micron's general, unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of Micron's existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the assets securing such debt, and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Micron's subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Indentures do not limit the amount of indebtedness that Micron or any of its subsidiaries may incur. ...This item was truncated.    Order free Annual Report for Micron Technology, Inc.

472,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2012. On April 18, 2012, Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") entered into a $2,000,000,000 senior unsecured credit facility, by and among the Company, as Borrower, the several lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the ""Credit Agreement""). The new credit facility refinances the credit facilities under the Company's prior credit agreement, dated as of June 23, 2010, by and among the Company, as Borrower, BSC International Holding Limited, as Term Loan Borrower, the several lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the ""2010 Facility""). The Company may borrow from time to time up to $2,000,000,000 in revolving credit loans under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on April 18, 2017, with one-year extension options subject to certain conditions, including certain lender approvals. Loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin. The applicable interest margin will be based on the Company's long-term, senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced corporate credit ratings from Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Based on the Company's current credit ratings and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, any Eurodollar Loans and Multicurrency Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.275 percent (compared to LIBOR plus 2.050 percent under the 2010 Facility), and any ABR Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.275 percent (compared to LIBOR plus 1.050 percent under the 2010 Facility). In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee (currently 0.225 percent per year, compared to 0.450 percent per year under the 2010 Facility), based on the Company's credit ratings, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the total amount of revolving credit commitments (generally irrespective of usage) under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. The ratios are calculated based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted pursuant to the Credit Agreement (""Consolidated EBITDA""). The Company is permitted to exclude from Consolidated EBITDA any Non-Cash Charges (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and any Cash Litigation Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and will be permitted to exclude from Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments, provided that the sum of any excluded Cash Litigation Payments and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments shall not exceed $2,300,000,000 in the aggregate. In addition, the Company may exclude from Consolidated EBITDA any cash and non-cash charges with respect to restructurings, plant closings, staff reductions, distributor network optimization initiatives, distribution technology optimization initiatives or other similar charges, provided that the aggregate amount of all such charges shall not exceed $500,000,000.

484,DELL,"       Dell Inc. (DELL) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on June 11, 2012. (e) In connection with the adoption by the Board of Directors of Dell Inc. (""Dell"") of the dividend policy described in Item 8.01 of this report, on June 11, 2012, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board (the ""Committee"") approved amendments to each outstanding restricted stock unit award (""RSU"") and performance-based restricted stock unit award (""PBU"") granted by Dell to its employees and directors under Dell's 2002 long-term incentive plan. The amendments to the awards provide that if Dell pays a cash dividend on its common stock, each holder of RSUs or PBUs will be entitled to receive a dollar amount equal to the per-share cash dividend paid by Dell, multiplied by the total number of shares issued upon the vesting of the stock units. The amounts that a holder of stock units is entitled to receive, which are cumulative to the extent that multiple cash dividends are paid, are referred to as ""dividend equivalents."" Any dividend equivalents credited to either an RSU or PBU award will be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms and conditions as the related stock units. Accordingly, no holder of a PBU will receive any dividend equivalent payments with respect to that award unless the PBU vests and is paid out following the achievement of the specified performance goals. In addition, any employee who forfeits either RSUs or PBUs upon termination of employment also will forfeit the right to receive payment of any dividend equivalents accumulated with respect to those stock units. Accumulated dividend equivalents will be paid in cash upon delivery of the shares underlying the relevant RSUs and PBUs. The stock unit awards subject to the amendments include awards held by Dell's currently serving named executive officers. As of the date of this report, Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, held no RSUs, Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, held RSUs for 219,895 shares, Stephen J. Felice, President, Chief Commercial Officer, held RSUs for 231,903 shares, and Stephen F. Schuckenbrock, President, Services, held RSUs for 312,642 shares. Each of these officers also held PBUs for a number of shares that will be fixed upon the vesting of such awards and based on performance. Although the final numbers of these PBUs will reflect actual performance outcomes, assuming the target performance metrics are achieved, Mr. Dell held PBUs for 1,058,974 shares, Mr. Gladden held PBUs for 407,365 shares, Mr. Felice held PBUs for 464,199 shares and Mr. Schuckenbrock held PBUs for 457,079 shares. The Committee determined that the amendments were appropriate in light of the Board's adoption of the dividend policy. As stock units are not outstanding shares of common stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends paid by the company, the crediting of dividend equivalents is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by Dell when the awards were granted and to treat the award holders consistently with stockholders.

502,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Changes to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 08, 2012. (a) At the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation that eliminated the plurality voting provision for the election of directors. Following that approval, the Company filed a corresponding Certificate of Amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. In the Proxy Statement, the Company indicated that if its stockholders approved the amendment, its Board of Directors would then also consider amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the ""Bylaws"") to implement a majority voting process for uncontested elections of directors. Accordingly, on July 9, 2012, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to Section 8 of the Company's Bylaws. These amendments provide that in an uncontested election of directors, if any nominee for director receives a greater number of ""withhold"" votes (ignoring abstentions and broker non-votes) than votes ""for"" his or her election, and the nominee is an incumbent director, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board of Directors and all committees thereof, subject to acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. Under the amended Bylaws, in making its recommendation, the Governance Committee will consider all factors it deems relevant including, without limitation, the stated reasons why stockholders withheld votes for election from such director, the length of service and qualifications of such director, the director's contributions to the Company and the availability of other qualified candidates for director. Under the amended Bylaws, the Governance Committee's evaluation shall begin promptly following certification of the voting results and shall be forwarded to the Board of Directors to permit the Board of Directors to act on it no later than ninety (90) days following the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. In reviewing the Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors shall consider the factors evaluated by the Governance Committee and such additional information and factors as the Board of Directors believes to be relevant. If the Board of Directors determines that the director's resignation is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Board of Directors shall promptly accept the resignation. The Company shall publicly disclose the Board of Directors' decision within four business days on a Form 8-K, providing an explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for not requesting the director's resignation. Any director who is the subject of the evaluation described in this section shall not participate in the Governance Committee's or the Board of Directors' considerations of the appropriateness of his or her continued service, except to respond to requests for information. If a majority of the members of the Governance Committee are subject to this evaluation process, then the independent directors on the Board of Directors (as most recently determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to applicable listing guidelines) who are not subject to the evaluation shall appoint a special committee of the Board of Directors amongst themselves solely for the purpose of conducting the required evaluation. The special committee will make the recommendation to the Board of Directors otherwise required of the Governance Committee. The foregoing description of these amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of Section 8, as revised, as set forth in the Amended and Restated Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.4 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.

505,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, 2012. On July 18, 2012, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the second quarter 2012. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, separation costs, a milestone payment, litigation reserves, acquired in-process research and development, restructuring and integration charges, cost reduction initiatives, the impairment of an R&D intangible asset, and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

509,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 01, 2012. On August 1, 2012, Cisco Systems, Inc. (""Cisco"") appointed Marc Benioff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of salesforce.com, inc., and Kristina M. Johnson, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Enduring Hydro, LLC, to its Board of Directors (the ""Board""). It has not yet been determined on which Board committees, if any, Mr. Benioff and Dr. Johnson will serve. In connection with their service as directors, Mr. Benioff and Dr. Johnson will receive Cisco's standard non-employee director cash and equity compensation. Mr. Benioff and Dr. Johnson will receive a pro rata portion of the $75,000 annual retainer for their service through the remaining portion of the year ending at Cisco's 2012 annual meeting of shareholders. If appointed to serve on any committees of the Board, they also would receive fees of $2,000 per committee meeting attended. In connection with their appointment, pursuant to the Board's equity grant policy for non-employee directors, Mr. Benioff and Dr. Johnson will automatically receive an initial non-employee director restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan covering 16,666 shares. Pursuant to this policy, because their appointment occurred during a closed trading window of Cisco, the automatic grant date for the restricted stock units will be the date of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board during an open trading window of Cisco at which that committee grants equity awards. The shares subject to these restricted stock unit awards will vest in two equal annual installments upon completion of each year of board service measured from the initial appointment date, and vest immediately in full upon certain changes in control or ownership of Cisco or upon their death or disability while a member of the Board. Non-employee directors may elect to defer receipt of the restricted stock units such that, to the extent the restricted stock units are vested, the units would be settled in shares after the non-employee director left the Board.

511,GM,"       General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Regulation FD Disclosure - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2012. Pursuant to disclosures being made by General Motors Financial Company Inc., our wholly owned captive finance company (""GM Financial"") we are simultaneously making this disclosure to fulfill Regulation FD requirements. Ally Financial Inc. (""Ally Financial"") has announced plans to divest its international operations in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Latin America. GM Financial and a number of other third parties submitted indicative bids in July and are at the preliminary stages of the bid process investigation. There is no assurance that GM Financial will be successful in acquiring any of Ally Financial's international operations. However, if GM Financial is successful in completing a transaction, it could expand its operations materially in international markets. Such expansion could have significant impacts on its business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. If GM Financial is the successful bidder, its consolidated assets could potentially more than double, and it could incur substantial amounts of indebtedness, including secured debt. Depending on the scale of the operations GM Financial may acquire and the amount of equity that it invests in such a transaction or transactions, its consolidated debt and other liabilities could potentially more than double and its ratio of adjusted assets (giving effect to the transaction or transactions) to adjusted equity (excluding goodwill) could potentially more than double as well.

512,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 15, 2012. On August 15, 2012, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 ended July 28, 2012. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may be subject to changes in tax legislation, court decisions, or tax settlements, that affect one or more prior fiscal years. The Registrant excludes the tax charges or benefits of these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies and impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

The authorization under the 2012 Repurchase Program, which took effect immediately, permits the Corporation to effect the repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases and/or other derivative transactions. On September 19, 2012, the Corporation entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction (the ""transaction"") with Barclays Bank PLC (the ""seller""). Under the terms of the transaction, the Corporation purchases outstanding shares of common stock from the seller for $1.2 billion. The seller makes an initial delivery of shares to the Corporation shortly after execution of the transaction, and may deliver additional shares to the Corporation at or prior to maturity of the transaction. The total number of shares to be repurchased will be based generally on the average daily volume weighted average price of the stock during the term of the transaction. Under certain circumstances, the Corporation may be required to return to the seller a portion of the initial shares received or make an additional cash payment to the seller. The transaction is scheduled to extend for approximately three months, but it may conclude earlier at the seller's option, and may be terminated early upon the occurrence of certain events. The agreement for the accelerated share repurchase transaction is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The transaction utilized approximately $1.0 billion authorized under the 2012 Repurchase Program and approximately $200 million that remained authorized under a share repurchase program approved in August 2011 (the ""2011 Repurchase Program""), completing the 2011 Repurchase Program. With respect to the remaining approximately $5.0 billion of the 2012 Repurchase Program, there can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions and other factors.

523,QCOM,"       QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2012. (e) On September 30, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the ""Company"") amended the Company's Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (""ERMCP"") to simplify the formula for determining the amount of employee contributions the Company will match under the ERMCP. Effective with respect to deferrals of bonuses earned for services rendered for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2012, and deferrals of salary earned on or after January 1, 2013, Company matching contributions will be equal to 50% of each participating employee's deferrals that do not exceed 16% of the employee's salary and bonus paid in the calendar year. The revised formula does not result in a material change to the value of the Company match on an individual or aggregate basis. Additionally, the Compensation Committee amended the ERMCP, effective with respect to the deferrals of bonuses earned for services rendered for fiscal years beginning after October 1, 2012, and for deferrals of salary earned on and after January 1, 2014, to provide that Company matching contributions will be made in cash, unless the Compensation Committee decides that the match should be made in Company stock. The Compensation Committee also amended the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (""LTIP"") to revise the limits on vesting of full value awards (e.g., restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and stock-based awards based on the full value of shares of Company common stock subject to the LTIP). Before the amendment, full value awards granted to employees that vest on the basis of the employee's continued service with the Company could not vest more rapidly than annual pro-rata vesting over a three-year period and full value awards that vest upon attainment of performance goals were required to provide for a performance period of at least twelve months. These vesting limitations were subject to an exception that allowed a maximum of 2% of shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP to be issued as awards to non-employee directors without regard to these vesting limitations. The amendment to the LTIP expands the exception to the vesting limitations, effective September 30, 2012, to (a) allow a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP to be issued without regard to the vesting limitations, and (b) include awards issued to employees as well as awards issued to non-employee directors.

On October 17, 2012, Abbott Laboratories announced its results of operations for the third quarter 2012. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, separation costs, litigation reserves, acquired in-process research and development, restructuring and integration charges, cost reduction initiatives, the impairment of an R&D intangible asset, and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations.

Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses.

540,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2012. (i) 2013 Annual Bonus Plan On October 30, 2012, upon the recommendation of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the Compensation Committee), the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company's 2013 Annual Bonus Plan effective for the performance period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. As part of the Company's overall compensation program, the 2013 Annual Bonus Plan provides an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel (including the Company's named executive officers meeting the eligibility criteria) based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. The 2013 Annual Bonus Plan is substantially similar to the Company's 2012 Annual Bonus Plan, as amended and restated, and provides: * for a single bonus pool (the Total Annual Bonus) that will be based on the Company's performance measured against achievement of corporate-level performance metric goals for adjusted earnings per share and global sales on a constant currency basis (Global sales); * the Total Annual Bonus (i) will be capped at 95% of the aggregate annual bonus pool target (the Aggregate Annual Target) in the event that the performance for Global sales is below 95% of the Company's approved performance goal for that metric; and (ii) will have a ceiling of 150% and a floor of 50% of the Aggregate Annual Target, with the Company's Board of Directors having discretion to terminate, suspend or modify the plan and to reduce the Total Annual Bonus based on the Company's performance relative to its quality objectives and performance of its quality systems; * the Total Annual Bonus will be allocated among corporate, global operations and each participating business, regional and country unit (each, a participating unit) based on each participating unit's overall and relative performance measured against its achievement of that unit's predetermined ""Scorecard"" performance metrics and goals and taking into consideration, as appropriate, other factors; such allocation will be a percentage of the annual bonus pool target for each participating unit (representing the total target annual bonuses of all eligible employees for the year within that unit) (each such allocated amount, an Assigned Bonus Pool); and * the Assigned Bonus Pool for each participating unit will then be allocated among all managers of plan participants within that participating unit. Such managers will then evaluate the performance of the participants under their management and determine, for each participant, the percentage (between 0% and 200%) of the participant's target annual bonus that will be used to determine the participant's bonus award. This description of the 2013 Annual Bonus Plan does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such plan. A copy of the 2013 Annual Bonus Plan is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated herein by reference. (ii) 2013 Performance Share Programs On October 30, 2012, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the adoption of two performance share programs, the Boston Scientific Corporation Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program for 2013 (the 2013 TSR PSP) and the Boston Scientific Corporation Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program for 2013 (the 2013 FCF PSP). These programs are substantially similar to the performance share programs for 2012 and represent an important component of the overall mix of the Company's long-term incentive program. Under both programs, performance share awards will be granted, if the relevant program criteria are met, to the Company's executive officers and certain members of its senior management team in the form of deferred stock units issued under the Company's 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was previously approved by the Company's stockholders. (A) 2013 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program The purpose of the 2013 TSR PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by comparing the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company's common stock to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2013 and ending on December 31, 2015 (the Performance Period). Under the 2013 TSR PSP, the TSR for the Company and such other companies will be measured in three annual performance cycles over the Performance Period. At the end of the Performance Period, the final TSR will be calculated using the simple average of the TSR for the three annual performance cycles. The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of zero to 200 percent (0-200%) of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's TSR rank. Performance share awards will vest only upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria set forth in the 2013 TSR PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. This description of the 2013 TSR PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2013 TSR PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated herein by reference. (B) 2013 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program The purpose of the 2013 FCF PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by providing incentives for the achievement of key business performance objectives critical to its success. Under the 2013 FCF PSP, performance will be measured by comparing the Company's free cash flow for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2013 and ending on December 31, 2013 against its 2013 financial plan performance for free cash flow. The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of zero to 150 percent (0-150%) of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's free cash flow as compared to its financial plan. Performance share awards will only vest upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria (which includes a three-year service period) set forth in the 2013 FCF PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. This description of the 2013 FCF PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program.

549,GM,"       General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 01, 2012. On November 1, 2012 (""Closing Date"") the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees (""SRP""), a pension plan sponsored by General Motors LLC (""GM LLC""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors Company (""Company""), purchased a Group Annuity Contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (""Prudential Insurance"") (""Contract""). Under the Contract, Prudential Insurance agreed to unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the full payment of all annuity payments to certain of GM LLC's salaried retirees, and assume all investment risk associated with the assets that were delivered as the group annuity contract premium. The Contract is held by an SRP pension trust and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Directed Trustee, executed the Contract on behalf of the SRP and the pension trust. Prudential Insurance had an existing annuity contract with the SRP valued at approximately $1 billion that was amended on the Closing Date so that all but a de minimis amount of the assets and obligations under that annuity contract are governed by the terms of the Contract. The total group annuity premium paid to Prudential Insurance on the Closing Date was $25.1 billion and is subject to customary data and mortality-related true-ups. The true-ups are not expected to be significant and will be substantially complete by December 31, 2012. Through the transactions contemplated in the Contract, including the settlement of other previously guaranteed obligations, and the previously announced lump-sum distributions to SRP participants, the Company is expecting to settle approximately $29 billion of pension obligations under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In order for the SRP to purchase the Contract and settle other previously guaranteed obligations, GM LLC expects to make approximately $2.6 billion in cash contributions to the SRP. In addition, the Company expects to record a pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a special item. The foregoing description of the Contract does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Contract, which will be filed by the Company with a subsequent Form 8-K.

On November 7, 2012, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the ""Company"") issued a press release announcing the Company's financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. A copy of that press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The press release includes non-GAAP financial measures as that term is defined in Regulation G. The press release also includes the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), information reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures, and a discussion of the reasons why the Company's management believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented therein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

551,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2012. On November 13, 2012, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal first quarter 2013 ended October 27, 2012. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, other acquisition-related costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory. This represents the amount of increase in inventory valuation resulting from the fair value adjustments required under purchase accounting for business combinations. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are primarily related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may be subject to changes in tax legislation, court decisions, or tax settlements, that affect one or more prior fiscal years. The Registrant excludes the tax charges or benefits of these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments and restructurings could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure for Dell's fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2012, and certain prior fiscal periods is included in the tables set forth under the heading ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" in Exhibit 99.1. In addition a detailed discussion of Dell's reasons for including the non-GAAP financial measures and the limitations associated with those measures is presented in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" in Dell's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2012. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, and earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

553,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Direct or off-Balance Sheet Financial Obligation - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 08, 2012. AbbVie Indenture and Supplemental Indenture On November 8, 2012, AbbVie Inc. (""AbbVie""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories (""Abbott""), entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee (the ""Trustee"") (as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No.1, dated November 8, 2012 (the ""Supplemental Indenture""), the ""Indenture""), relating to the issuance by AbbVie of $3,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.200% senior notes due 2015 (the ""Fixed 2015 Notes""), $4,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.750% senior notes due 2017 (the ""2017 Notes""), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.000% senior notes due 2018 (the ""2018 Notes""), $3,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.900% senior notes due 2022 (the ""2022 Notes""), $2,600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.400% senior notes due 2042 (the ""2042 Notes"" and together with the Fixed 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the ""Fixed Rate Notes"") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its floating rate senior notes due 2015 (the ""Floating 2015 Notes""). The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating 2015 Notes are collectively hereinafter referred to as the ""Notes,"" and each of the Fixed 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2042 Notes and the Floating 2015 Notes, are hereinafter referred to as a ""series"" of Notes. The Notes, except for $3,037,486,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the ""Exchanged Notes""), were issued and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") and non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act (the ""Private Placement""). The Exchanged Notes were issued by AbbVie to Abbott as partial consideration for the transfer to AbbVie of assets (including interests in intangible assets and stock of subsidiaries) used in connection with the proprietary pharmaceutical business of Abbott and its subsidiaries. Abbott then exchanged the Exchanged Notes with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (""Morgan Stanley"") in satisfaction and discharge of commercial paper that was previously issued by Abbott to Morgan Stanley. The Exchanged Notes were sold by Morgan Stanley in the Private Placement. Abbott has guaranteed each series of Notes on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, pursuant to a Guarantee, dated as of November 8, 2012, in favor of the Trustee for the holders of the Notes (the ""Guarantee""). The Guarantee will terminate upon the previously announced distribution by Abbott of shares of AbbVie common stock to shareholders of Abbott. AbbVie intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes (other than the Exchanged Notes) to make a cash distribution to Abbott, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. Abbott intends to use the proceeds it receives from AbbVie, in part, to fund its previously announced cash tender offers for certain of Abbott's outstanding notes. AbbVie may redeem all of the Notes of each series, other than the Floating 2015 Notes, at any time, and some of the Notes of each series, other than the Floating 2015 Notes, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may not redeem the Floating 2015 Notes prior to maturity. Subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, the Indenture limits AbbVie's ability and the ability of AbbVie's subsidiaries to create or permit to exist mortgages with respect to principal domestic properties and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal domestic properties, and limits AbbVie's ability to merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey, transfer or lease AbbVie's properties and assets substantially as an entirety. The Indenture also provides for certain events of default (subject, in certain cases, to receipt of notice of default and/or customary grace or cure periods), including, but not limited to, (i) failure to pay interest for 30 days, (ii) failure to pay principal when due, (iii) failure to perform, or breach of, any other covenant in the Indenture for 90 days after notice is given by the trustee or the holders of 25% of the outstanding principal amount and (iv) certain specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of AbbVie. Purchase Agreement The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement""), dated as of November 5, 2012, by and among AbbVie, Abbott as Guarantor, Morgan Stanley as Selling Noteholder and Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and the other several purchasers named in Schedule I thereto as Initial Purchasers (the ""Initial Purchasers""). Registration Rights Agreement On November 8, 2012, AbbVie, Abbott and the Initial Purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Notes (the ""Registration Rights Agreement""). AbbVie and Abbott agreed under the Registration Rights Agreement to (i) file a registration statement on an appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer to exchange the Notes for new notes, with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes and (ii) cause the registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act. If the exchange offer is not completed on or before November 4, 2013, AbbVie will use its reasonable best efforts to file and to have declared effective a shelf registration statement relating to the resales of the Notes. If AbbVie fails to satisfy this obligation (a ""registration default"") under the Registration Rights Agreement, the annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by 0.25%. The annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by an additional 0.25% for each subsequent 90-day period during which the registration default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00% per year. If the registration default is corrected, the applicable interest rate on the Notes will revert to the original level. If AbbVie must pay additional interest, AbbVie will pay it to the holders of the Notes in cash on the same dates that it makes other interest payments on the Notes, until the registration default is corrected. The preceding is a summary of the terms of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Guarantee and the Registration Rights Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report, the Supplemental Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this report, the Guarantee filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this report and the Registration Rights Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this report, each of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

554,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 15, 2012.

(""Cisco"") held on November 15, 2012, Cisco's shareholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Cisco Executive Incentive Plan (the ""EIP""). Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (""Section 162(m)""), shareholders must approve the material terms of the EIP at least every five years. The amendment and restatement of the EIP was approved by the Compensation & Management Development Committee of Cisco's Board of Directors on August 1, 2012, subject to the approval of Cisco's shareholders in accordance with Section 162(m). The amendment and restatement of the EIP became effective commencing with fiscal 2013 with such shareholder approval on November 15, 2012. The EIP is an incentive compensation plan which motivates and rewards eligible employees, including each of Cisco's named executive officers, by making a portion of such eligible employees' cash compensation dependent on the achievement of certain objective performance goals related to the performance of Cisco and its affiliates. Previously, the EIP was approved by shareholders at the 2007 annual meeting. As a result of the approval by shareholders at the Meeting, the amended and restated EIP is substantially the same as the version approved by shareholders in 2007 with the exception of three new performance conditions (operating cash flow, operating expenses and total shareholder return). A more complete description of the terms of the amended and restated EIP can be found in ""Proposal No. 2 Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the Executive Incentive Plan"" (pages 19 through 21) in Cisco's definitive proxy statement dated September 24, 2012, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 26, 2012, which description is incorporated by reference herein.

583,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2013. Overview On January 17, 2013, Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron"") and certain of its subsidiaries entered into, and simultaneously consummated the transactions contemplated by, an agreement (the ""Master Agreement"") with Nanya Technology Corporation (""NTC"") and Inotera Memories, Inc. (""Inotera""). Inotera is a publicly traded, Taiwan-based company that presently manufactures DRAM products and sells such products exclusively to Micron and NTC. Micron and its subsidiaries and NTC together own a majority of Inotera's outstanding voting shares. Pursuant to the Master Agreement, the parties thereto terminated or amended certain existing agreements and entered into certain new agreements, for the purpose of (i) restructuring the arrangements under which Inotera supplies its output to Micron and NTC, so that all of such output is transitioned to Micron during 2013, (ii) terminating the existing joint development program between Micron and NTC, (iii) restructuring existing arrangements among Micron, NTC and Inotera relating to the governance of Inotera, and (iv) restructuring certain agreements between Micron, NTC and Inotera relating to other intellectual property matters. Set forth below are brief descriptions of the Master Agreement and the material agreements related to the transactions contemplated thereby. Master Agreement Micron, Micron Semiconductor B.V. (""MNL""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron, Numonyx Holdings B.V. (""Numonyx B.V.""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron, Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte. Ltd. (""MSA""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron, Micron Technology Asia Pacific, Inc. (""MTAP""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron, are parties to the Master Agreement with NTC and Inotera. The Master Agreement provided for, among other things, (i) the termination of Inotera's existing supply agreement with Micron and NTC, the execution of a new supply agreement between Inotera and NTC and the execution of a new Supply Agreement among Inotera, Micron and MSA, (ii) the termination of the existing joint venture agreement relating to Inotera and the execution of a new joint venture agreement relating to Inotera, (iii) the termination of the existing facilitation agreement relating to Inotera and the execution of a new facilitation agreement relating to Inotera, (iv) the termination of an existing guaranty by Micron and the execution of a new guaranty by Micron, (v) the execution of a technology transfer and license option agreement for the 20nm process node between Micron and NTC, (vi) the execution of an omnibus intellectual property agreement between Micron and NTC, and (vii) the execution of an omnibus intellectual property agreement between Micron and Inotera. Supply Agreement Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Micron and MSA entered into a Supply Agreement with Inotera (the ""Supply Agreement""), pursuant to which Inotera will sell to Micron all of the DRAM products manufactured by Inotera other than DRAM products that are sold by Inotera to NTC during 2013 pursuant to a separate supply agreement between Inotera and NTC (the ""NTC Supply Agreement""). Under the NTC Supply Agreement, from February 1, 2013, NTC will only have the right to purchase the DRAM products resulting from less than five percent (5%) of Inotera's capacity. The price for DRAM products sold under the Supply Agreement is based on a discount from actual market prices. Micron has the right to terminate the Supply Agreement if certain events occur, including, among others, Inotera failing to meet certain specified targets for ramping new technologies, Inotera breaching the Supply Agreement or a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar events relating to Inotera. The Supply Agreement is retroactively effective as of January 1, 2013. The Supply Agreement has an initial three-year term and contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions. If in any year the parties do not agree to an extension, the Supply Agreement provides that it would terminate following the end of the then-existing term and a subsequent three-year wind-down period. Joint Venture Agreement Pursuant to the Master Agreement, MNL, Numonyx B.V. and MTAP entered into a new Joint Venture Agreement (the ""Joint Venture Agreement"") with NTC that governs the rights and obligations of the parties in connection with their ownership of shares of Inotera. Under the Joint Venture Agreement, each of MNL and NTC may initially designate five of the twelve members of the Board of Directors of Inotera. In addition, MNL and NTC may each nominate one independent director of Inotera. If required by applicable law, the Board of Directors of Inotera will be expanded and a third independent director, who will be nominated jointly by MNL and NTC, will be added, provided that, if MNL and NTC do not agree on the nominee, such director will be nominated by MNL. Beginning in 2016 (or, subject to certain conditions, such earlier time as determined by MNL), MNL may designate five of the directors and nominate one of the independent directors, NTC may designate four of the directors and nominate one of the independent directors and a third independent director will be nominated jointly by MNL and NTC, provided that, if MNL and NTC do not agree on the nominee, such director will be nominated by NTC. Each of the parties to the Joint Venture Agreement is required to vote its shares of Inotera for the board designees and nominees described above. In addition, each of the parties to the Joint Venture Agreement is required to vote its shares of Inotera in favor of two supervisors of Inotera selected by MNL and two supervisors of Inotera selected by NTC. The Joint Venture Agreement provides that the parties will use their best efforts to cause actions by Inotera's Board of Directors to require a two-thirds vote. The parties will also use their best efforts to allow each of NTC and MNL the right to nominate certain executive officers of Inotera, which officers will serve at the pleasure of Inotera's Board of Directors. The Joint Venture Agreement also imposes certain restrictions on the transfer by the parties of shares in Inotera and prohibits acquisitions of shares of Inotera by NTC and, subject to certain conditions, certain of its affiliates, from third parties. The Joint Venture Agreement contains buy/sell arrangements that may be initiated in the event of: (i) an uncured breach by a party of the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement; (ii) unresolved deadlock among the parties; or (iii) the ownership of MNL and its affiliates, on the one hand, or NTC and its affiliates, on the other hand, in Inotera falling below 5% of the outstanding shares of Inotera. However, if MNL and its affiliates, collectively, are buying (or have the right or obligation to buy) 50% or more of Inotera's DRAM output in any calendar year, then NTC may only initiate a buy/sell arrangement if there is an uncured breach by MNL, Numonyx B.V. or MTAP of the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement. MNL, Numonyx B.V. and MTAP are not required to contribute capital to Inotera. Facilitation Agreement Pursuant to the Master Agreement, MNL, Numonyx B.V. and MTAP entered into a new Facilitation Agreement with NTC and Inotera, pursuant to which Inotera will take certain actions, subject to, in some cases, applicable laws, approvals of its Board of Directors and/or approvals of its shareholders, to fully effectuate the intent of MNL, Numonyx B.V., MTAP and NTC under the Joint Venture Agreement with respect to, among other things, the nomination of executive officers. Micron Guaranty Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Micron entered into a new Micron Guaranty Agreement in favor of NTC, pursuant to which Micron guarantees, for the benefit of NTC, the performance of MNL, Numonyx B.V. and MTAP under the Joint Venture Agreement. Technology Transfer and License Option Agreement for 20nm Process Node Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Micron and NTC entered into a Technology Transfer and License Option Agreement for the 20nm Process Node (the ""TTLOA 20""), pursuant to which Micron granted NTC an option, subject to certain conditions, to have Micron transfer and license certain technologies relating to the manufacture of DRAM products on a 20nm process node. If NTC exercises such option, NTC will pay Micron a technology transfer fee, as well as royalties for its license from Micron. The TTLOA 20 is retroactively effective as of January 1, 2013. ...This item was truncated.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, losses on extinguishment of debt, costs related to the separation of Abbott's research-based pharmaceuticals business, litigation reserves, acquired in-process research and development, tax audit settlements, restructuring and integration costs, cost reduction initiatives, and the effect of the change in the calendar year-end for international operations. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

598,CVS,"       CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2013. (d): On March 29, 2013, the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of CVS Caremark Corporation (""CVS Caremark"" or the ""Corporation"") elected William C. Weldon to serve on the Board. Mr. Weldon, age 64, is the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson, a global developer and manufacturer of health care products, having served in those positions from 2002 until his retirement as Chief Executive Officer in April 2012 and his retirement from the board in December 2012. Mr. Weldon previously served in a variety of senior executive positions during his 41-year career with Johnson & Johnson. He is also a director of JPMorgan Chase & Co., a global financial services company. Mr. Weldon's experience in managing a complex global health care company and his deep knowledge of the worldwide health care market across multiple sectors makes him extremely well suited to serve on the Board. His background in international business management and operating in the highly-regulated health care industry is also greatly valued by the Board. CVS Caremark directly purchased approximately $740 million of products from Johnson & Johnson during the 2012 calendar year. CVS Caremark also purchased Johnson & Johnson products through various third parties, such as drug wholesalers. All of such purchases were made in the ordinary course of business based on arm's length negotiations between Johnson & Johnson or such third parties and CVS Caremark. In addition, during 2012 Johnson & Johnson paid CVS Caremark certain rebates for prescription drug dispenses made by CVS Caremark. Such rebates are usual and customary in the industry and were based on arm's length negotiations. The majority of such rebates were passed on to the various clients of CVS Caremark's prescription benefit management business. Mr. Weldon was not involved in the negotiation of any purchases, sales, contracts or business arrangements between the two companies. Mr. Weldon was determined by the Board to be ""independent"" under the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange and under the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board in making its determination as to Mr. Weldon's independence considered that, consistent with its categorical standards to assist in independence determinations, Mr. Weldon is a former executive officer of an entity with which the Corporation has had ordinary course, arm's-length business dealings that do not implicate any of the New York Stock Exchange's bright-line tests, and that he was not directly involved in such entity's business dealings with the Corporation. Mr. Weldon will receive compensation as a director in accordance with the Corporation's director compensation practices described in the Corporation's definitive Annual Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2013.

601,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on March 27, 2013. (e) On March 27, 2013, the independent Directors of the Board of Directors (""Board"") of Chevron Corporation (""Chevron"") approved a $100,000 increase to the annual base salary of J.S. Watson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,800,000, and ratified the decision of the Management Compensation Committee of the Board to increase the annual base salary of P.E. Yarrington, Chevron's Chief Financial Officer, by $70,000, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,000,000, and to increase the annual base salary of the following executives who are named in the Summary Compensation Table in Chevron's 2012 Proxy Statement: G.L. Kirkland, increase of $50,000, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,450,000; M.K. Wirth, increase of $50,000, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,050,000; and R.H. Pate, increase of $44,000, resulting in an annual base salary of $825,000. These base salary increases will be effective April 1, 2013. The independent Directors of the Board also approved under the Chevron Incentive Plan (""CIP"") an annual cash bonus for 2012 to Mr. Watson in the amount of $3,480,000 and ratified the decision of the Management Compensation Committee of the Board to approve the following annual cash bonuses: Ms. Yarrington, $1,339,200; Mr. Kirkland, $2,200,000; Mr. Wirth, $1,260,000; and Mr. Pate, $948,900. Amounts awarded under the CIP are determined by a formula, which is calculated by multiplying a pre-determined percentage of the executive's 2012 base salary by a corporate performance rating determined by the Management Compensation Committee based on its assessment of Chevron's performance for the year, with the resulting amount being further adjusted up or down based on individual performance. In determining the amounts, the independent Directors of the Board took into account Chevron's strong 2012 financial and operating performance, including the second highest earnings in Chevron's history, strong total shareholder return, safety performance and progress throughout the year on important capital projects and commercial transactions that served to strengthen the portfolio of the company. A more detailed description of how amounts are calculated and the reasons for the amounts awarded will be included in Chevron's Proxy Statement for the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In order to correct an administrative error in calculating the number of stock options and performance shares awarded on January 30, 2013 under the Long Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (""LTIP"") to Messrs. Watson, Kirkland and Wirth (""January 2013 Grants""), on March 27, 2013, the independent Directors of the Board amended Mr. Watson's January 2013 Grant from 415,000 stock options to 377,000 stock options and from 52,000 performance shares to 47,000 performance shares and ratified the following grants to Messrs. Kirkland and Wirth approved by the Management Compensation Committee of the Board on March 26, 2013 (""March 2013 Grant""): Mr. Kirkland, 14,000 stock options and 2,000 performance shares, resulting in a total of 149,000 stock options and 21,500 performance shares for 2013; and Mr. Wirth, 3,000 stock options and 400 performance shares, resulting in a total of 93,000 stock options and 12,400 performance shares for 2013. These changes corrected the error and delivered the grant value the independent Directors of the Board intended to deliver in the January 2013 Grants. In determining the value of the CIP and LTIP awards for Messrs. Watson, Kirkland and Wirth, the independent Directors of the Board took into account certain 2012 operating incidents. The stock options granted to Mr. Kirkland and Mr. Wirth under the March 2013 Grant have a ten year term, with one-third of the grant vesting at each anniversary of the date of grant, except as described below in the penultimate paragraph, and with an exercise price of $120.19 per share, which is based on the closing price of Chevron's common stock on the March 27, 2013 date of grant. The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (TSR) for the performance period as compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group (BP p.l.c., ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c. and Total S.A.). The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period, multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the peer group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the modifier will be the average of the sum of all the modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the peer group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The Management Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. Since Mr. Kirkland has more than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the March 27, 2013 date of grant will vest upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules. Since Mr. Wirth has more than 75 points but less than 90 points under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding options and performance shares held for at least one year from the March 27, 2013 date of grant will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the options grant date (or, for performance shares, the performance period start date) to the separation from service date, up to 36 months, divided by 36 months) upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules.

606,ABT,"       Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2013. On January 1, 2013, Abbott Laboratories (""Abbott"") completed the previously announced distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie Inc. (""AbbVie"") to Abbott's shareholders. AbbVie is now an independent public company trading under the symbol ""ABBV"" on the New York Stock Exchange. Furnished as Exhibit 99.1 is Abbott's unaudited non-GAAP financial information for 2012 reflecting the presentation of the AbbVie business as a discontinued operation and other adjustments to provide a historical baseline of Abbott's standalone operating results from continuing operations and excluding specified items. Abbott plans to evaluate its future results from continuing operations against this historical baseline. Exhibit 99.1 also provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP information to Abbott's historical consolidated results in accordance with GAAP. Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others: net earnings excluding specified items and diluted earnings per common share excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, losses on extinguishment of debt, costs related to the separation of AbbVie, litigation reserve adjustments, acquired in-process research and development, tax audit settlements, restructuring and integration costs, and cost reduction initiatives. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar to how Abbott's management internally assesses performance. Abbott's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following description of the Retention Awards is qualified in all respects by the terms of the Retention Awards, which are described in the special retention program overview and the form of special retention award agreement filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this current report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02(e). Under the terms of the Retention Awards, award recipients are entitled to receive performance-based cash bonuses ranging from 0% to 100% of their respective base salaries based on the Company's fiscal year 2014 free operating cash flow performance. This bonus will be payable in March 2014 if the award recipient has remained continuously employed by the Company through the payment date. If the Company terminates the award recipient's employment without cause prior to the payout date, the award recipient is entitled to receive 75% of the maximum Retention Award value as soon as administratively practicable following termination of employment. The Retention Awards provide that if any rights, payments or benefits provided by the Company to an award recipient following a change in control of the Company (""Change in Control Payments"") would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 or non-deductibility under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Golden Parachute Code Sections""), payment of the Retention Award will be reduced or eliminated to the extent necessary to avoid application of the excise tax so long as the reduction or elimination would result in a larger net after-tax payment (the ""Best-After Tax Result"") to the award recipient in connection with the Change in Control Payments. Also on April 17, 2013, the Committee approved amendments to the Company's equity award agreements for grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs"") and performance-based restricted stock units (""PBUs"") issued under the Dell Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Dell Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the ""Existing Award Grants""). The following description of these amendments is qualified in all respects by the terms of the amendments, which are filed as Exhibits 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6 to this current report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02(e). The amendments provide for accelerated vesting of Existing Award Grants if the recipient's employment with the Company is terminated without cause within two years following a change in control of the Company. Any accrued dividend equivalents with respect to the RSUs and PBUs will vest and be paid in cash upon delivery of the shares underlying the RSUs and PBUs. In addition, in connection with a change in control of the Company, the amendments provide that the Board or Committee may direct that, in lieu of delivering shares of Company common stock upon the vesting of awards, the Company may provide for award holders to receive cash or other consideration of at least equal value. Such other consideration would continue to be subject to the vesting conditions applicable to the Existing Award Grants and also would have the benefit of accelerated vesting if the recipient's employment with the Company is terminated without cause within two years following the change in control. With respect to PBUs, the amendments provide that if not otherwise provided for in any agreement pursuant to which the transactions constituting the change in control are effected, the PBUs will be deemed to be earned at the target level of performance. The amendments provide for reduction or elimination of vesting or payment of long-term incentive plan awards to the extent necessary to produce the Best After-Results in the application of the Golden Parachute Code Sections. No amendments were made to Equity Award Grants held by Mr. Dell or by members of the Board. The Existing Award Grants subject to the amendments include awards held by the Company's currently serving named executive officers, other than Mr. Dell. As of the date of this report, Brian T. Gladden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, held RSUs for 95,886 shares, and Stephen J. Felice, President, Chief Commercial Officer, held RSUs for 95,886 shares. Each of these officers also held PBUs for a number of shares that will be fixed upon the vesting of such awards and based on performance outcomes. Assuming the target performance metrics are achieved or deemed to be achieved, Mr. Gladden held PBUs for 353,283 shares and Mr. Felice held PBUs for 401,577 shares. In addition, the maximum Retention Award payable to Mr. Gladden based on his base salary would be $775,000, and the maximum Retention Award payable to Mr. Felice based on his base salary would be $800,000.

630,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 2013. On May 15, 2013, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal third quarter 2013 ended April 27, 2013. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, other acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory. This represents the amount of increase in inventory valuation resulting from the fair value adjustments required under purchase accounting for business combinations. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related/divestiture costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may incur tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal years as a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. The Registrant excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

Pursuant to the Agreement, Cisco will enter into a settlement and patent license with TiVo (the ""Settlement Agreement""). Under the terms of the Agreement, Cisco will pay TiVo a single lump sum of $294 million upon execution of the Settlement Agreement. Cisco and TiVo have agreed that Cisco will receive a perpetual license to the patents-in-suit.

The settlement expires ten years from the effective date. In connection with the settlement, Cisco expects to recognize charges in Cisco's fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 as consideration for past damages, with an impact of approximately $0.03 per share to GAAP earnings per share.

Prior to the close, Cisco and Sourcefire will continue to operate as separate companies.

Parent is owned by Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. Amendment No. 1 provides for an increase in the per share merger consideration to be paid to the Company's stockholders from $13.65 per share in cash, without interest, to $13.75 per share in cash, without interest, provides for the Company to pay a special $0.13 per share cash dividend to holders of record as of a date to be determined prior to the effective time of the merger, and permits the Company to advance the record date for the quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share with a record date that would otherwise fall between September 26, 2013 and October 16, 2013 to ensure that such record date precedes the effective time of the merger and enable the Company to comply with notice requirements under applicable law with respect to such record date. Amendment No. 1 also revises the condition to the closing of the merger that required the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the Unaffiliated Stockholders (as defined below) to instead require the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Unaffiliated Stockholders that are present in person or by proxy and that are voted for or against the proposal to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement.

Amendment No. 1 also decreases the termination fee the Company would have to pay to Parent from $450 million in cash to $180 million in cash in the event that within twelve months of termination of the Amended Merger Agreement by the Company or Parent in connection with the Company's stockholders not voting to adopt the Amended Merger Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any recapitalization, or any extraordinary dividend or share repurchase, or a recapitalization, or an extraordinary dividend or share repurchase, is consummated that, together with any related transactions, would not result in any Person or group beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company. Amendment No. 1 also provides that the Company will take all necessary action to reduce the exercise price per share of each option to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, whether vested or unvested, by the amount of the $0.13 per share special cash dividend and that holders of restricted stock units with respect to shares of common stock of the Company and restricted shares of common stock of the Company will receive such special dividend as dividend equivalents or dividends payable, as applicable, at the time that amounts are payable in respect of such restricted stock units and restricted stock pursuant to the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 (""Fiscal 2014""), which ended May 3, 2013, Dell completed the reorganization of its reportable segments from the customer-centric segments it maintained through fiscal year 2013 (""Fiscal 2013"") to reportable segments based on the following product and services business units: End-User Computing (""EUC""); the Enterprise Solutions Group (""ESG""); the Dell Software Group; and Dell Services.

EUC includes desktop PCs, thin client products, notebooks, tablets, third-party software, and EUC-related peripherals, while ESG includes servers, networking, storage, and ESG-related peripherals. The Dell Software Group includes systems management, security, and information management software offerings. Dell Services includes a broad range of IT and business services, including support and deployment services, infrastructure, cloud, and security services, and applications and business process services. The change in Dell's reportable segments did not impact Dell's previously reported consolidated net revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, or earnings per share. Dell has recast the presentation of the Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012, and Fiscal 2011 segment information originally included in the Fiscal 2013 Form 10-K to be consistent with the reorganized segment structure.

Unless consented to by MSA, Elpida will only supply products to MSA and not to any other customers. These supply obligations will commence on the first date on which both Elpida's manufacturing, sales and other operational computing systems have been converted to Micron's enterprise resource planning system and all court approvals relating to the implementation of the cost plus model at Elpida have been obtained. Until that time, Elpida will continue to operate under its existing supply arrangements with third party customers. Under the General Services Agreement, MSA is committed to place orders every month for general and administrative services to be performed by Elpida, and Elpida is committed to provide the ordered services. The obligations of the parties under the General Services Agreement will commence on the same date that their supply obligations commence under the Supply Agreement. Under the R&D Agreement, Micron is committed to place orders every month for research and development services to be performed by Elpida, and Elpida is committed to provide the ordered services. All intellectual property produced under the R&D Agreement will be owned by Micron. The obligations of the parties under the R&D Agreement will commence on the date Micron acquires all of Elpida's intellectual property, which will occur shortly after the closing of the Elpida acquisition in connection with the implementation of the cost plus model. Pricing for the products and services under the Cost Plus Agreements will be charged on a cost plus basis, subject to limited exceptions, and are intended to cover all of Elpida's costs, subject to limited exceptions.

681,CSCO,"       Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 14, 2013. On August 14, 2013, Cisco Systems, Inc. (the ""Registrant"") reported its results of operations for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 ended July 27, 2013. A copy of the press release issued by the Registrant concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibits hereto, shall not be deemed to be ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibits include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP net income per share data and non-GAAP inventory turns. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Registrant believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Registrant's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Registrant's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP net income per share data when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Registrant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP inventory turns provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to inventory management based on the operating activities of the periods presented. For its internal budgeting process, the Registrant's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, other acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements (such as the patent litigation settlement with TiVo, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013), the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. The Registrant's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Registrant. In prior periods, the Registrant has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. As described above, the Registrant excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee stock options, employee stock purchase rights, employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Registrant does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Registrant believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The Registrant incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. The Registrant excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory. This represents the amount of increase in inventory valuation resulting from the fair value adjustments required under purchase accounting for business combinations. These amounts arise from the Registrant's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Other acquisition-related/divestiture costs. In connection with its business combinations, the Registrant incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time the Registrant enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. The Registrant may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. The Registrant excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Registrant's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings. The Registrant from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. The Registrant excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements. The Registrant from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements. The Registrant excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. The Registrant may incur tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal years as a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. The Registrant excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items, such as significant gains or losses from contingencies, that the Registrant may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Registrant will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, and other acquisition-related costs, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. The Registrant could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods.

(""Cisco"") announced a workforce reduction plan. Cisco is rebalancing its resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5 percent of Cisco's global workforce. Cisco expects to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Cisco currently estimates that it will recognize pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results in an amount not expected to exceed $550 million consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. These charges are primarily cash-based. Cisco expects that approximately $250 million to $300 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 with the remaining amount to be recognized during the rest of the fiscal year. The foregoing contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include the size of the reduction and the amount and timing of the related charges. Statements regarding future events are based on Cisco's current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated risks related to the completion of the reduction in force in the manner anticipated by Cisco. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: Cisco's ability to implement the workforce reductions in various geographies; possible changes in the size and components of the expected costs and charges associated with the plan; and risks associated with Cisco's ability to achieve the benefits of the planned workforce reduction. For information regarding other factors that could cause Cisco's results to vary from expectations, please see the ""Risk Factors"" section of Cisco's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

705,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Exit or Disposal Activities - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 22, 2013. On October 22, 2013, the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved, and the Company committed to, a 2014 restructuring program (the ""Program""). The Program is intended to build on the progress the Company has made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace, further strengthen its operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments. Key activities under the Program include continued implementation of the Company's ongoing Plant Network Optimization (PNO) strategy, continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes. The PNO strategy is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities. Other activities involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics. These activities will start to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. The Company estimates that the Program will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $150 million to $200 million exiting 2015, and expects a portion of the Program savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. The Company anticipates a gross reduction of 1,100 to 1,500 positions worldwide through a combination of employee attrition and targeted headcount reductions as a result of the Program implementation. Plans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, and the Company will work with employee representative bodies where required under local laws. The Company estimates that the implementation of the Program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million, of which approximately $160 million to $210 million is expected to result in future cash outlays. The following table provides a summary of the Company's estimates of costs associated with the Program by major type of cost: Type of cost Total estimated amount expected to be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $120 million to $150 million Other (1) $5 million to $15 million Restructuring-related expenses: Other (2) $50 million to $60 million $175 million to $225 million (1) Consists primarily of consultant fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations. (2) Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, and costs to transfer product lines among facilities. The Company estimates that during the fourth quarter of 2013, it will record approximately $30 million of restructuring charges associated with the Program. The Company will record the remaining expenses throughout the duration of the Program when it identifies with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated and as other Program-related expenses are incurred.

708,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 22, 2013. (i) 2014 Annual Bonus Plan On October 22, 2013, upon the recommendation of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the ""Compensation Committee""), the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved the Company's 2014 Annual Bonus Plan effective for the performance period January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. As part of the Company's overall compensation program, the 2014 Annual Bonus Plan provides an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel (including the Company's named executive officers meeting the eligibility criteria) based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. The 2014 Annual Bonus Plan is substantially similar to the Company's 2013 Annual Bonus Plan and provides: for a single bonus pool (the ""Total Annual Bonus"") that will be based on the Company's performance measured against achievement of corporate-level performance metric goals for adjusted earnings per share and global sales on a constant currency basis (""Global sales""); the Total Annual Bonus as operated (i) will be capped at 95% of the aggregate annual bonus pool target (the ""Aggregate Annual Target"") in the event that the performance for Global sales is below 95% of the Company's approved performance goal for that metric; and (ii) will have a ceiling of 150% and a floor of 50% of the Aggregate Annual Target, with the Board having discretion to terminate, suspend or modify the plan and to reduce the Total Annual Bonus based on the Company's performance relative to its quality objectives and performance of its quality systems; the Total Annual Bonus will be allocated among corporate, global operations and each participating business, regional and country unit (each, a ""participating unit"") based on each participating unit's overall and relative performance measured against its achievement of that unit's predetermined ""Scorecard"" performance metrics and goals and taking into consideration, as appropriate, other factors; such allocation will be a percentage of the annual bonus pool target for each participating unit (representing the total target annual bonuses of all eligible employees for the year within that unit) (each such allocated amount, an ""Assigned Bonus Pool""); and the Assigned Bonus Pool for each participating unit will then be allocated among all managers of plan participants within that participating unit. Such managers will then evaluate the performance of the participants under their management and determine, for each participant, the percentage (between 0% and 200%) of the participant's target annual bonus that will be used to determine the participant's bonus award. Awards to certain executive officers under the 2014 Annual Bonus Plan are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek reimbursement of a bonus award in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. The Company may also seek reimbursement of a bonus award if there is a restatement of the Company's financial results that would have reduced a previously granted bonus award's size or payment. The amount to be recouped would be the amount of any such reduction. Finally, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a bonus award, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the bonus award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the 2014 Annual Bonus Plan was established. This description of the 2014 Annual Bonus Plan does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such plan. A copy of the 2014 Annual Bonus Plan is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. (ii) 2014 Performance Share Programs On October 22, 2013, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the adoption of two performance share programs, the Boston Scientific Corporation 2014 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program (the ""2014 TSR PSP"") and the Boston Scientific Corporation 2014 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program (the ""2014 FCF PSP""). These programs are substantially similar to the performance share programs for 2013 and represent an important component of the overall mix of the Company's long-term incentive program. Under both programs, performance share awards will be granted, if the relevant program criteria are met, to the Company's executive officers in the form of deferred stock units issued under the Company's 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was previously approved by the Company's stockholders. Awards to certain executive officers under both programs are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek recovery of performance share units in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. In addition, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a performance share award, under the Dodd-Frank Act or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the performance share award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the performance share award was granted. (A) 2014 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program The purpose of the 2014 TSR PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by comparing the Total Shareholder Return (""TSR"") of the Company's common stock to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2016 (the ""Performance Period""). The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 200% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's TSR rank. Performance share awards will vest only upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria set forth in the 2014 TSR PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. This description of the 2014 TSR PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2014 TSR PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. (B) 2014 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program The purpose of the 2014 FCF PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by providing incentives for the achievement of key business performance objectives critical to its success. Under the 2014 FCF PSP, performance will be measured by comparing the Company's free cash flow for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2014 against its 2014 financial plan performance for free cash flow. The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 150% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's free cash flow as compared to its financial plan. Performance share awards will only vest upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria (which includes a three-year service period) set forth in the 2014 FCF PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. This description of the 2014 FCF PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2014 FCF PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.

Summary of Terms of the New Notes. The New Notes will be issued under an indenture, to be dated as of November 12, 2013, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of New Notes will have an issue price of $800 for purposes of the indenture for the New Notes. An amount equal to the difference between the issue price and the principal amount at maturity will accrue in accordance with a schedule to be set forth in the indenture for the New Notes. The issue price plus such accrued amount per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of New Notes is referred to herein as the ""accreted principal amount."" The New Notes will have an interest rate of 3.00% per year per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2014, and will mature on November 15, 2043, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.

The New Notes will have an initial conversion rate of 34.2936 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (""Common Stock""), per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of New Notes, subject to adjustment, and will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company's Common Stock or any combination of cash and shares of the Company's Common Stock, at the Company's election. Prior to August 15, 2043, the New Notes will be convertible at such times as certain conditions set forth in the indenture for the New Notes have been satisfied. In the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture), holders of the New Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. Holders of New Notes who convert their New Notes in connection with a make-whole change in control (as defined in the indenture) or in connection with a redemption of such New Notes prior to November 20, 2018 will, under, certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate determined by reference to a make-whole table set forth in the indenture. The Company may elect to redeem all or any portion of the New Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount at maturity of New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the daily volume weighted average price of the Company's Common Stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period.

The indenture applicable to the New Notes will include customary events of default. Upon an event of default which is continuing, the accreted principal amount of New Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated. Notice of Conversion Termination with respect to 2027 Notes. On November 7, 2013, the Company gave notice in accordance with the indenture applicable to the 2027 Notes of its election to terminate the right of noteholders to convert the 2027 Notes into cash and shares of the Company's Common Stock effective as of December 13, 2013 and its election to settle any conversions prior to the effective time of such termination entirely in cash. As a result, the right of holders to convert 2027 Notes will terminate at the close of business on December 13, 2013. Upon any conversions effected prior to the conversion right termination date, in addition to being entitled to receive a cash amount equal to the conversion settlement value with respect to the converted notes determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, the converting holder will be entitled to receive a payment equal to the aggregate amount of interest payments that would have been payable on such converted 2027 Notes from June 1, 2013 to, but excluding, June 1, 2014, discounted to the present value of such amount, or $9.38 per $1,000 of principal amount.

The 2031A Notes will continue to be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the last business day prior to the redemption date. The Company currently expects to elect to settle any such conversions of the 2031A Notes entirely in cash, although under the indenture applicable to the 2013A Notes, it may settle amounts payable in respect of conversions in excess of the $1,000 principal amount of each note in cash, shares or a combination thereof. Upon any conversions effected prior to the close of business on the last business day prior to the redemption date, in addition to being entitled to receive the conversion settlement value with respect to the converted notes determined in accordance with the formula forth in the indenture governing the 2031A Notes, the converting holder will be entitled to receive a payment equal to the aggregate amount of interest payments that would have been payable on such converted 2031A Notes from August 1, 2013 to, but excluding, August 5, 2015, discounted to the present value of such amount. The Company expects to use approximately $525 million of cash on hand in connection with the anticipated conversions of the 2027 Notes and 2031A Notes as a result of the early termination of the conversion right with respect to the 2027 Notes and the call for redemption of the 2031A Notes assuming an $18 stock price for each trading day of the applicable measurement period.

727,MSFT,"       Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2013. Microsoft Corporation (the ""Company"") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to recast certain prior period amounts to conform with the segment reporting changes made in connection with realignment of our organization structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company, as well as to disclose the retrospective adoption of new accounting guidance, with respect to the financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013 (""2013 Form 10-K""). During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result of these changes, information that the Company's chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we are reporting our financial performance based on our new segments; Devices and Consumer (""D&C"") Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other. We began to report comparative results under the new organization structure with the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. We also provided a description of the new reporting structure and a summary of the effects of these changes on the Company's historical segment results for fiscal year 2013 and 2012 in two Form 8-Ks filed on September 19, 2013 and September 26, 2013. The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require that when a registrant prepares, on or after the date a registrant reports an accounting change such as the change noted above, a new registration, proxy or information statement (or amends a previously filed registration, proxy, or information statement) that includes or incorporates by reference financial statements, the registrant must recast the prior period financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the registration, proxy or information statement to reflect these types of changes. Accordingly, the Company is filing this Form 8-K to recast our consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013, to reflect the changes in segment reporting as described above. The updates do not represent a restatement of previously issued financial statements. The recast information of Items contained in the Company's 2013 Form 10-K is presented in Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 to this Form 8-K. Effective July 1, 2013, we adopted new accounting guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity's right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure, and applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. Beginning in fiscal year 2014, we also adopted accounting guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI""). This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. We adopted the new guidance described above beginning July 1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of certain notes to financial statements. The requirements of this guidance have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented in this Form 8-K. The information included in this Form 8-K is presented for informational purposes only in connection with the reporting changes described above and does not amend or restate our audited consolidated financial statements, which were included in our 2013 Form 10-K. This Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring after we filed our 2013 Form 10-K and does not modify or update the disclosures therein in any way, other than to illustrate the realignment of our organizational structure and the retrospective application of recently adopted accounting guidance as described above.

743,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 16, 2013. On December 16, 2013, Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte. Ltd. (""Micron Singapore""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron""), priced an offering of US$462,278,000 in aggregate principal amount of 1.258% Secured Notes Due 2019 (the ""Notes""). The sale of the Notes is expected to close on December 20, 2013, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Notes will be governed by an Indenture dated December 16, 2013 (the ""Indenture""), by and among Micron Singapore, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the indenture trustee (the ""Indenture Trustee""), Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as security trustee (the ""Security Trustee""), and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (""Ex-Im Bank""). Micron has guaranteed all of Micron Singapore's obligations under the Notes. Upon Ex-Im Bank's endorsement of a guarantee legend on the Notes (one of the closing conditions for the sale of the Notes), payment of 100% of all regularly scheduled installments of principal of, and interest on, the Notes will be guaranteed by Ex-Im Bank. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be used to (i) reimburse Micron Singapore for the payment of costs incurred by Micron Singapore for the purchase of certain equipment and certain other eligible goods and services in connection with the acquisition and operation of such equipment and (ii) finance the premium charged by Ex-Im Bank for the issuance of its guarantee of the scheduled installments of principal of, and interest on, the Notes. The Notes are secured by a charge over certain of Micron Singapore's equipment. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2019 and will bear interest at a rate of 1.258% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2014. The principal amount of the Notes will be payable in 10 consecutive semi-annual installments payable in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2014. At any time prior to the maturity date of the Notes, Micron Singapore may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus a ""make-whole premium"" as described in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts then due under the Indenture or the related documents, if any, to the date of redemption. If Micron Singapore, Micron or certain related persons described in the Indenture are or become a person to whom Ex-Im Bank is prohibited by law from providing financing or other credit support by reason of sanctions imposed by the United States under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (as amended and in effect from time to time), Micron Singapore will be required, as described in the Indenture, to redeem the Notes in whole, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a ""make-whole premium,"" together with accrued and unpaid interest and any other unpaid amounts then due under the Indenture or the related documents, if any, to the date of redemption. The Indenture contains covenants which are customary for financings of this type, including negative covenants that limit or restrict Micron Singapore's ability to create liens or dispose of the equipment securing the Notes. Events of default under the Indenture include, among others, the following (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods): nonpayment, breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the Indenture and related transaction documents, default of payment of certain indebtedness on scheduled due dates or acceleration of certain indebtedness, default in the payment of other indebtedness owed to Ex-Im Bank, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency with respect to Micron Singapore or Micron, and subject to certain further conditions, the occurrence of any event or circumstance that, in the reasonable judgment of Ex-Im Bank, is likely materially and adversely to affect the ability of Micron Singapore or Micron to perform any payment obligation, or all or any of its other obligations which are material obligations, under the Indenture, the Notes or under any other related transaction documents to which it is a party. Generally, if an event of default other than due to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency is continuing, Ex-Im Bank or, under certain limited circumstances, holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. If an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Micron Singapore or Micron is continuing, the principal of, and accrued but unpaid interest on, all Notes would become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The Indenture Trustee, the Security Trustee and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Micron or its affiliates, including the provision of banking and cash management services, foreign exchange hedging and equipment financing and leasing services.

The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (TSR) for the performance period as compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group (BP p.l.c., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c. and Total S.A.). The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the peer group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the modifier will be the average of the sum of all the modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the peer group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The Management Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. The restricted stock units vest on January 29, 2017, payout in cash based on the closing price of Chevron common stock on the date of vesting (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and do not accrue dividend equivalents. Since Mr. Watson, Mr. Kirkland, and Ms. Yarrington each has more than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 29, 2014 date of grant will vest upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules. Since Mr. Wirth has more than 75 points but less than 90 points under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 29, 2014 date of grant will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the options grant date (or, for performance shares, the performance period start date) to the separation from service date, up to 36 months, divided by 36 months) upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules.

786,GM,"       General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on April 01, 2014. U.S. Sales On April 1, 2014, General Motors Company issued a news release announcing March 2014 U.S. sales. The release and charts are attached as Exhibit 99.1. Venezuelan Operations Previously we utilized the official exchange rate of Bolivar Fuerte (BsF) 6.3 to $1.00 set by the Venezuelan government for remeasuring the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Effective March 31, 2014 we are changing the exchange rate we use for remeasuring these amounts to the rate determined by an auction process conducted by Venezuela's Complimentary System of Foreign Currency Administration (""SICAD I""). At March 31, 2014 the SICAD I exchange rate was BsF 10.7 to $1.00. This change in exchange rate was made as we believe the SICAD I rates are the most representative rates to be used for remeasurement, as the official rate of BsF 6.3 to $1.00 will increasingly be reserved only for the settlement of USD-denominated obligations related to purchases of ""essential goods and services"" and future dividends will likely not be paid at the official rate. The net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries may be impacted by periodic auctions in SICAD I rates which may have a material impact to the results of operations in Venezuela in future quarters. We expect this change in exchange rate to result in a pre-tax remeasurement charge of approximately $400 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014. The remeasurement charge will be treated as special for EBIT-adjusted reporting purposes.

791,QCOM,"       Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on May 05, 2014. (e) On May 5, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Qualcomm Incorporated (the ""Company""), approved a series of compensation-related decisions that are designed to (i) restructure former Chief Executive Officer Dr. Paul E. Jacobs' compensation to align it with his new role as Executive Chairman, (ii) make changes to Derek K. Aberle's compensation to reflect his new role as President, (iii) front-load the restricted stock unit (""RSU"") portion of the compensation that the Compensation Committee expected to award each of Qualcomm's eight Executive Vice Presidents (""EVPs"") over the next three years to help ensure that they remain at Qualcomm, and (iv) provide special one-time RSUs for three executive officers in response to competitive risk. The Compensation Committee reported these actions to the Board and the independent members of the Board unanimously supported them. Qualcomm is an established leader in mobile communications. The Company's competitors and other companies, including early-stage companies backed by venture or private equity capital that are not constrained by the more traditional public company pay model, are implementing mobile strategies and are investing significantly in mobile, and the Board believes these efforts include the recruitment of members of Qualcomm management. In recent months, certain Qualcomm senior executives have been targeted for employment outside of the Company, and these employment opportunities included compelling compensation. While competitive recruiting efforts have been unsuccessful, the Board believes the competitive threat will only increase. The Board believes that it is crucial that Qualcomm position itself to meet these challenges, and that Qualcomm trails other industry leaders in adopting more aggressive retention programs. The Board believes that it is in stockholders' best interests to realign the compensation of the senior management team to incentivize them to remain with Qualcomm and to continue to create value for stockholders. The compensation changes announced today are structured to help ensure Qualcomm retains its key talent so that it can remain well positioned to compete successfully and continue delivering stockholder value. Qualcomm's New Executive Chairman As previously announced, in conjunction with Steve Mollenkopf's appointment to the role of Chief Executive Officer effective March 4, 2014, Dr. Jacobs was named to the new and vital role of Executive Chairman, in which he remains a full-time executive and member of the Qualcomm management team in addition to his duties as Chairman of the Board. The Company also announced on March 10, 2014 the promotion of Mr. Aberle to President. The Board is pleased to have the world-class talents of these three executives, who have worked together building Qualcomm for over 14 years, and believes these are the optimal roles for each of them to continue to grow the Company. As Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mollenkopf will set corporate strategy, lead the operations of the Company, oversee product development and manage global relationships, with all of the senior management team reporting to him. In his new role as Executive Chairman, Dr. Jacobs will focus on long-term opportunities in emergent areas and managing certain relationships with key partners around the world in addition to his responsibilities as Chairman of the Board. Dr. Jacobs has repeatedly demonstrated a unique ability to understand technology trends and how Qualcomm can capitalize on them. After these compensation changes take effect, Dr. Jacobs' compensation will be fully equity-based, with an annual salary of one dollar and no annual cash bonus. In addition, the Compensation Committee has made a special one-time equity grant to Dr. Jacobs in the form of RSUs with a grant date fair value of $45 million. Consistent with the Company's annual RSU grant practices, these RSUs include a feature under which the Company must meet an adjusted GAAP operating income target in order for them to vest. All of the RSUs described herein, including those granted to Mr. Aberle and the EVPs, include this feature. Dr. Jacobs' RSUs vest in three equal installments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. Dr. Jacobs' unvested RSUs would be forfeited if he were to depart the Company voluntarily - creating strong incentives for him to remain with Qualcomm into the future. For at least the next five years following this grant, the Compensation Committee expects that Dr. Jacobs' annual direct compensation will be entirely in the form of performance-based stock units (""PSUs""), which would be granted concurrently with the annual PSUs the Compensation Committee anticipates awarding to all of the Company's executive officers during the fourth fiscal quarter. Compensation for Qualcomm's New President In connection with his promotion to President, the Compensation Committee has made certain changes to align Mr. Aberle's compensation with his new role and to enhance the retentive effect of his compensation. Mr. Aberle's base salary has been increased to $780,000 per year and his annual cash bonus target has been increased from 130% of base salary to 135% of base salary. In addition, the Compensation Committee has front-loaded the RSU portion of the compensation that it expected to award to Mr. Aberle over the next five years. These RSUs have a grant date fair value of $16.1 million and will vest annually in five equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Unvested RSUs would be forfeited if Mr. Aberle were to depart Qualcomm. Lastly, the Compensation Committee has awarded Mr. Aberle a special one-time equity grant in the form of RSUs with a grant date fair value of $10.5 million, which will vest in three equal installments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. The Compensation Committee anticipates that it will continue to grant annual PSUs to Mr. Aberle. Retaining Other Key Executives for the Future Front-Loaded RSUs. The Compensation Committee has also front-loaded the RSU portion of the compensation that it expected to award to each of Qualcomm's eight EVPs over the next three years. This front-loading of RSUs mirrors that of Mr. Mollenkopf's and Mr. Aberle's new compensation structures. These RSUs will vest annually in five equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. The EVPs who were Named Executive Officers (""NEOs"") in Qualcomm's most recent Proxy Statement received RSUs as follows: George Davis, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, $6.9 million; and Donald J. Rosenberg, EVP, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, $6.2 million. Unvested RSUs would be forfeited if any of these executives were to depart Qualcomm. This should significantly strengthen the incentives of these executives to remain at Qualcomm by increasing the amount of owned equity that would be forfeited if an executive were to depart, without increasing the value of compensation paid by the Company over this timeframe. The Compensation Committee anticipates that it will continue to grant annual PSUs to these executives. Special One-Time RSUs. In addition, the Compensation Committee awarded special one-time equity grants in the form of RSUs to three key non-NEO EVPs. These RSUs will vest in three equal installments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. Unvested RSUs are forfeited if the executive departs. Aligned with Stockholders' Interests Performance for Stockholders. As the Compensation Committee undertook this review of Qualcomm's executive compensation in light of the recent changes made to the senior management team and the increasing competitive threat Qualcomm faces for talent, it has strongly favored equity-based compensation, which it believes is the best means to incentivize and retain the management team. At all levels, the Compensation Committee has taken care, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, to design Qualcomm's compensation programs to be competitive and to be aligned with stockholders' interests.

810,ORCL,"       Oracle Corp. (ORCL) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on June 22, 2014. On June 22, 2014, Oracle Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""Oracle""), MICROS Systems, Inc., a Maryland corporation (""MICROS"" or the ""Company""), OC Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle (""Parent""), and Rocket Acquisition Corporation, a Maryland corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Subsidiary""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon terms and conditions thereof: (i) Merger Subsidiary has agreed to commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the shares of the Company's common stock (the ""Offer"") for a purchase price of $68.00 per share, net to the holders thereof, in cash (the ""Offer Price""), without interest; and (ii) after completion of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation of the merger (the ""Merger""). Merger Subsidiary has agreed to commence the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement (but in no event later than ten (10) business days from the date of the Merger Agreement). The consummation of the Offer will be conditioned on (i) at least a majority of the shares of the Company's common stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis in accordance with the Merger Agreement) having been validly tendered into and not withdrawn from the Offer, (ii) receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and applicable merger control laws of the European Commission, and, if applicable, approval under certain other foreign antitrust laws, (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance with the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to qualifications, and (iv) other customary conditions. The Merger Agreement provides that, following the consummation of the Offer, subject to very limited conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, the Merger will occur, pursuant to which each outstanding share of the Company's common stock (other than treasury shares, shares held by Oracle, Parent or Merger Subsidiary or shares held by any subsidiaries of the Company or Oracle (other than Parent or Merger Subsidiary)) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. In connection with the Offer and Merger, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Tender and Support Agreement agreeing to tender their shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and to support the Offer and the Merger. In addition, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the unvested portion of each Company stock option (each Company option, a ""Company Compensatory Award"") that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding at the time the Merger is consummated and held by an employee or consultant to the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be assumed by Oracle and converted automatically into an option denominated in shares of Oracle common stock, the number and terms of which will be determined pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The vested portion of each Company Compensatory Award that is outstanding at the time the Merger is consummated and is held by an employee or consultant to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and the vested and unvested portion of each Company Compensatory Award that is outstanding at the time the Merger is consummated and is held by a person who is not an employee of, or a consultant to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the time the Merger is consummated, will be cancelled and extinguished and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such Company Compensatory Award will have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the time the Merger is consummated and (y) the Offer Price less any per share exercise or purchase price of such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to such cancellation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed not to solicit or support any alternative acquisition proposals, subject to customary exceptions for the Company to respond to and support unsolicited proposals in the exercise of the duties of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company will be obligated to pay a termination fee of approximately $157.78 million to Parent in certain customary circumstances. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and agreed to recommend that the Company's stockholders accept the tender offer and tender their shares of the Company's common stock to Merger Subsidiary in the tender offer. Oracle has agreed to cause the payment and performance of Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's liability and obligations under the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K to provide information regarding the terms of the agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Oracle or MICROS in Oracle's or MICROS' public reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or otherwise.

821,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Regulation FD Disclosure - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 23, 2014. The information set forth in this Item 7.01 is intended to be furnished under Item 7.01 of Form 8-K (Regulation FD Disclosure). This information shall not be deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. In addition, this information shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless it is specifically incorporated by reference in such filing. Micron Technology, Inc. is furnishing certain financial information regarding its business, including the following events that occurred subsequent to May 29, 2014: We prepaid a capital lease obligation of approximately $50 million that was due in quarterly installments through 2016. The prepayment of this financing resulted in a reduction of (i) cash of $50 million, (ii) current debt of $23 million and (iii) long-term debt of $27 million. We repurchased approximately $28 million and $30 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.375% convertible senior notes due 2032 and 3.125% convertible senior notes due 2032, respectively, for an aggregate price of approximately $197 million. The repurchase of these notes resulted in reductions in (i) cash aggregating $197 million, (ii) long-term debt aggregating $49 million and (iii) total Micron shareholders' equity aggregating $148 million. We entered into a capital lease obligation for approximately $79 million, resulting in increases in (i) current debt of $15 million and (ii) long-term debt of $64 million. We delivered an irrevocable notice to prepay $32 million aggregate principal amount in respect of a term loan, which payment is scheduled to be made on July 31, 2014. The loan is due in semi-annual installments through 2018. On July 23, 2014, we gave notice to holders of our outstanding 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the ""2031B Notes"") that their notes will be redeemed on August 22, 2014, except to the extent such notes are converted or repurchased by us prior to such date. Based on the current conversion rate of 105.2632 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2031B Notes and assuming for purposes of calculating the settlement value under the indenture for the 2031B Notes that the volume weighted average price of our common stock is $33.15 per share (the closing sales price of the our common stock on July 18, 2014) for each trading day of the applicable measurement period, if all of the 2031B Notes were converted prior to the redemption date for such notes, the aggregate amount the we would be required to pay with respect to such conversions if we elected to pay solely cash upon conversion, which is our current intent, would be approximately $402 million. Based on such assumptions, we expect to incur a non-operating loss of $28 million on the conversion and settlement of the 2031B Notes. As used herein, ""we,"" ""our,"" ""us"" and similar terms included herein refer to Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

825,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 28, 2014. On July 28, 2014, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Micron""), closed the sale of $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""Notes"") pursuant to a purchase agreement, dated July 23, 2014, with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein (the ""Representatives""). The Notes were offered and sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Indenture The Notes are governed by an indenture (the ""Indenture""), dated as of July 28, 2014, by and between Micron and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""Trustee""). The Notes mature on February 1, 2025, and interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 5.50% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on February 1, 2014. Prior to August 1, 2019, Micron may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a ""make-whole"" premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. On or after August 1, 2019, Micron may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at specified prices that decline over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, Micron may use the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes prior to August 1, 2017 at a price equal to 105.50% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If Micron experiences specified change of control triggering events, Micron must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Micron and/or its domestic restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which Micron owns at least 80% of the voting stock) to: create or incur certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; and consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the Indenture. The following events are considered events of default under the Indenture: Micron's failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on any Note when due at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; Micron's failure to pay interest, including any additional interest, on any of the Notes for 30 days after the date when due; Micron's failure to give timely notice of specified change of control triggering events, which failure continues for a period of 30 days; the failure by Micron or any of its subsidiaries to comply with any other agreement under the Indenture for a period of 90 days after receiving notice of such failure from the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes as required by the Indenture; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to Micron or any of its significant subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) which specified events shall not include (i) certain events under the laws of jurisdictions other than the laws of the jurisdiction of such person's incorporation or organization or the jurisdiction of its head office or jurisdictions in which all or substantially all of such person's assets are located, and (ii) specified events with respect to any such person as a result of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceedings that were ongoing or in process at the time such person became a subsidiary or any related proceedings (including alternate proceedings) or other such proceedings that are in the nature of either a continuation or extension thereof. If an event of default described in the last bullet point above occurs and is continuing with respect to Micron, then the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Notes will automatically become due and immediately payable without any further action or notice. If any other event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, then either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Notes due and immediately payable. The description of the Notes and the Indenture contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Indenture and the form of note included in the Indenture, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Registration Rights Agreement In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Micron also entered into a registration rights agreement, dated July 28, 2014, with the Representatives (the ""Registration Rights Agreement""). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, if any Notes are not freely transferable by non-affiliates pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act within 366 days after their original issuance, Micron is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes (the ""Exchange Notes"") with terms identical to the Notes (except that the Exchange Notes will not be subject to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate and interest thereon shall accrue from the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes or, if no such interest has been paid, from July 28, 2014).

Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Motorola Solutions, Inc. notified Cisco Systems, Inc. (""Cisco"") and its Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of his decision to resign from the Board effective July 31, 2014 to ensure there are no interlocking directorates under Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (the ""Clayton Act""). The Board of Directors has reduced the size of the Board to eleven members effective with Mr. Brown's resignation on July 31, 2014. At the time Mr. Brown joined Cisco's Board in January 2013 the companies' overlapping revenue was within the safe harbor provided for in the Clayton Act. Following the close of Cisco's 2013 fiscal year, Cisco determined that the overlapping revenue was no longer within the safe harbor requiring Mr. Brown to resign within one year if the companies did not fall back within the safe harbor during that time. Cisco and Motorola Solutions have concluded that the requirement will not be fulfilled within the requisite time period. On April 15, 2014, Motorola Solutions announced its intention to sell its Enterprise business to Zebra Technologies Corporation, but that transaction has not yet closed. Upon closing of that transaction, the companies' overlapping revenue would again be within the safe harbor provided for in the Clayton Act.

859,BSX,"       Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2014. (i) 2015 Annual Bonus Plan On October 28, 2014, upon the recommendation of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the ""Compensation Committee""), the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved the Company's 2015 Annual Bonus Plan effective for the performance period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. As part of the Company's overall compensation program, the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan provides an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel (including the Company's named executive officers meeting the eligibility criteria) based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. The 2015 Annual Bonus Plan is substantially similar to the Company's 2014 Annual Bonus Plan and provides: for a single bonus pool (the ""Total Annual Bonus"") that will be based on the Company's performance measured against achievement of corporate-level performance metric goals for adjusted earnings per share and global sales on a constant currency basis (""Global sales""); the Total Annual Bonus as operated (i) will be capped at 95% of the aggregate annual bonus pool target (the ""Aggregate Annual Target"") in the event that the performance for Global sales is below 95% of the Company's approved performance goal for that metric; and (ii) will have a ceiling of 150% and a floor of 50% of the Aggregate Annual Target, with the Board having discretion to terminate, suspend or modify the plan and to reduce the Total Annual Bonus based on the Company's performance relative to its quality objectives and performance of its quality systems; the Total Annual Bonus will be allocated among corporate, global operations and each participating business, regional and country unit (each, a ""participating unit"") based on each participating unit's overall and relative performance measured against its achievement of that unit's predetermined ""Scorecard"" performance metrics and goals and taking into consideration, as appropriate, other factors; such allocation will be a percentage of the annual bonus pool target for each participating unit (representing the total target annual bonuses of all eligible employees for the year within that unit) (each such allocated amount, an ""Assigned Bonus Pool""); and the Assigned Bonus Pool for each participating unit will then be allocated among all managers of plan participants within that participating unit. Such managers will then evaluate the performance of the participants under their management and determine, for each participant, the percentage (between 0% and 200%) of the participant's target annual bonus that will be used to determine the participant's bonus award. Awards to certain executive officers under the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek reimbursement of a bonus award in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. The Company may also seek reimbursement of a bonus award if there is a restatement of the Company's financial results that would have reduced a previously granted bonus award's size or payment. The amount to be recouped would be the amount of any such reduction. Finally, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a bonus award, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the bonus award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan was established. This description of the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such plan. A copy of the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. (ii) 2015 Performance Share Programs On October 28, 2014, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the adoption of two performance share programs, the Boston Scientific Corporation 2015 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program (the ""2015 TSR PSP"") and the Boston Scientific Corporation 2015 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program (the ""2015 FCF PSP""). These programs are substantially similar to the performance share programs for 2014 and represent an important component of the overall mix of the Company's long-term incentive program. Under both programs, performance share awards will be granted, if the relevant program criteria are met, to the Company's executive officers in the form of deferred stock units issued under the Company's 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was previously approved by the Company's stockholders. Awards to certain executive officers under both programs are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek recovery of performance share units in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. In addition, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a performance share award, under the Dodd-Frank Act or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the performance share award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the performance share award was granted. (A) 2015 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program The purpose of the 2015 TSR PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by comparing the Total Shareholder Return (""TSR"") of the Company's common stock to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2015 and ending on December 31, 2017 (the ""Performance Period""). The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 200% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's TSR rank. Performance share awards will vest only upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria set forth in the 2015 TSR PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. This description of the 2015 TSR PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2015 TSR PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. (B) 2015 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program The purpose of the 2015 FCF PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by providing incentives for the achievement of key business performance objectives critical to its success. Under the 2015 FCF PSP, performance will be measured by comparing the Company's free cash flow for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2015 and ending on December 31, 2015 against its 2015 financial plan performance for free cash flow. The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 150% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's free cash flow as compared to its financial plan. Performance share awards will only vest upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria (which includes a three-year service period) set forth in the 2015 FCF PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability. This description of the 2015 FCF PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2015 FCF PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference. (iii) Amendment and Restatement of Executive Retirement Plan On October 28, 2014, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the Boston Scientific Corporation Executive Retirement Plan effective November 1, 2014 (as amended and restated, the ""Plan""). The amendments reflected in the Plan, among other things, create an additional participant eligibility classification for employees that are ""Grandfathered Individuals. ...This item was truncated.

868,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 02, 2014. On December 2, 2014, Micron Technology, Inc. (the ""Company"") and one of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (""MSP"" and together with the Company, the ""Borrowers""), entered into a Credit Agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Co-Collateral Agent, Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Book Runner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Co-Collateral Agent and Syndication Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Joint Lead Arranger and Joint Book Runner, Bank of America, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Joint Book Runners and Co-Documentation Agents, and certain financial institutions, as lenders (the ""Credit Agreement""). The Credit Agreement provides the Borrowers with a committed $600 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility includes a $100 million letter of credit sublimit and $40 million discretionary swingline sublimit. The Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances (including the agreement of financial institutions in their sole discretion to provide additional commitments), the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement may be increased up to $800 million at the Borrowers' request. As of the date of the filing of this Current Report there are no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Company and MSP are both borrowers under the Credit Agreement and are jointly and severally liable for the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Borrowers will use borrowings under the Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured on a first priority basis by the Company's inventory and by MSP's inventory and accounts receivable, in each case together with certain related assets. The Credit Facility matures on December 2, 2019 (the ""Maturity Date""). The Borrowers must repay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the Credit Agreement, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, on the Maturity Date. Availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility from time to time is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of the Borrowers' eligible inventories (including raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process inventory) and MSP's eligible accounts receivable, each multiplied by an applicable advance rate. Availability of borrowings is further reduced by an amount equal to 10% of the Credit Facility size and may be further reduced by reserves determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its permitted discretion. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Borrowers' option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus an additional interest rate margin that is determined by the average monthly availability of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The additional interest rate margin for borrowings ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% per annum in the case of base rate borrowings and from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum in the case of LIBOR borrowings. In addition, the Borrowers will pay a commitment fee on the undrawn commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time according to the average monthly balance of borrowings (which balance also will include outstanding letters of credit) under the Credit Agreement during the most recent month. This commitment fee on undrawn commitments ranges from a rate of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum, with the applicable rate determined by the average monthly balance of borrowings (including letters of credit) under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for credit agreements of this type, including as a funding condition the absence of any event or circumstance that has a material adverse effect on our business, assets, operations or financial condition, and including negative covenants that limit or restrict the Borrowers' ability to create liens on, or dispose of, the collateral securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement does not contain financial covenants and does not contain any covenant restricting the payment of dividends or the making of other restricted payments by the Borrowers. Events of default under the Credit Agreement include, among others, the following (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods): nonpayment of principal, interest or any other amount due under the Credit Facility, breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the Credit Agreement and related transaction documents, default of payment of certain indebtedness of a Borrower in excess of $100 million on scheduled due dates or acceleration, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency with respect to a Borrower, and the Company ceasing to own at least 50.1% of the equity of MSP. If an event of default other than due to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency is continuing, the Administrative Agent or holders of a majority of the lenders holding unused commitments and borrowings under the Credit Agreement may (i) terminate the obligations of the lenders to make loans and the obligation of the issuing banks to issue letters of credit, (ii) declare the obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and/or (iii) exercise legal and contractual rights and remedies. If an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company and/or MSP is continuing, the obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement would be due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company or its affiliates, including the provision of investment banking, commercial banking and cash management services, foreign exchange hedging and equipment financing and leasing services. The foregoing description of the Credit Facility and the Credit Agreement are only summaries of certain terms and agreements discussed herein.

881,CVS,"       CVS Health Corp. (CVS) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2015. (d): On January 20, 2015, the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of CVS Health Corporation (the ""Corporation"") elected Richard M. Bracken to serve on the Board. Mr. Bracken, age 62, is the retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HCA Inc. and HCA Holdings, Inc. (collectively, ""HCA""), one of the nation's leading providers of health care services. HCA's facilities include approximately 165 hospitals and 115 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and England. Mr. Bracken served in a number of executive roles in his 30+ year career at HCA, including Chief Executive Officer of the Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in San Diego, California, and Chief Executive Officer of Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1995, Mr. Bracken was appointed President of HCA's Pacific Division, Western Group President in 1997, Chief Operating Officer of the Company in July 2001, and President and Chief Operating Officer in January 2002. He was elected to the HCA Board of Directors in November 2002, became President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2009, and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in December, 2009. He retired as CEO in December 2013, and as Chairman in December 2014. Mr. Bracken also has served on numerous professional and community boards and is a Fellow in the American College of Healthcare Executives. Since 2007, CVS/caremark, the Corporation's pharmacy benefit management service provider (""CVS/caremark""), has had a Master Coalition Agreement with Healthtrust Purchasing Group, L.P. (""HealthTrust""), a group purchasing organization. The general partner of HealthTrust is a subsidiary of HCA, and HCA, through certain of its subsidiaries, owns approximately 54% of HealthTrust. Under the Master Coalition Agreement, HealthTrust, on behalf of its coalition members (including HCA and approximately 65 unaffiliated entities), agreed to certain terms and conditions for pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") services provided by CVS/caremark, and in 2014 CVS/caremark paid HealthTrust approximately $13.3 million under the Master Coalition Agreement. Also as part of this arrangement, each coalition member has directly entered into a sub-agreement with CVS/caremark for PBM services. Under the terms of its sub-agreement, HCA and its employee participants paid CVS/caremark approximately $305 million in 2014 (including both prescription drug spend, a portion of which is passed through to various members of our retail pharmacy network, and administrative service fees). Mr. Bracken was not directly involved in the negotiation or administration of either HealthTrust's Master Coalition Agreement or HCA's sub-agreement with CVS/caremark. Mr. Bracken was determined by the Corporation's Board to be ""independent"" under the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange and under the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines. He was also appointed to the Board's Audit Committee, effective March 3, 2015. The Board in making its determination as to Mr. Bracken's independence considered that, consistent with its categorical standards to assist in independence determinations, Mr. Bracken is a former executive officer of an entity with which the Corporation has had ordinary course, arm's-length business dealings that do not implicate any of the New York Stock Exchange bright-line tests, and with respect to which he was not directly involved in such entity's business dealings with the Corporation. Mr. Bracken's compensation for service as a non-employee director will be consistent with that of the Corporation's other non-employee directors, subject to proration to reflect the commencement date of his service on the Board. The Corporation's director compensation practices are described under the caption ""Director Compensation"" in the Corporation's Annual Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2014. (e) In addition, effective January 22, 2015, the Corporation and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Larry J. Merlo, agreed to modify all outstanding stock option agreements between the Corporation and Mr. Merlo to reflect that, solely for the purpose of the stock option agreements, Mr. Merlo is eligible for ""Approved Early Retirement"" at or after attaining age of 60 (instead of age 55) if such retirement is approved in advance by the Management Planning & Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the ""Committee""), and for ""Normal Retirement"" at or after attaining age of 65 (instead of age 60). Mr. Merlo is required to provide at least 12 months' advance notice to the Committee of his intent to take Approved Early Retirement or Normal Retirement. In addition, all future stock option agreements between the Company and Mr. Merlo will incorporate the same definitions of Approved Early Retirement and Normal Retirement. The description of the modifications to Mr. Merlo's stock option agreements contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment, dated January 22, 2015, to the Corporation's Business Planning Committee Nonqualified Stock Option Agreements with Mr. Merlo, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

886,CVX,"       Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2015. (b) and (c) As described in the press release that is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, on January 28, 2015, Matthew J. Foehr, Vice President and Comptroller of Chevron Corporation (""Chevron""), elected to retire, effective March 31, 2015. Also on January 28, 2015, the Chevron Board of Directors elected Jeanette L. Ourada to the position of Vice President and Comptroller of Chevron, effective April 1, 2015. (d) On January 28, 2015, Chevron Corporation (""Chevron"") issued a press release announcing that on that day the Board of Directors (""Board"") elected Inge G. Thulin to the Board and named Mr. Thulin to the Board Nominating and Governance Committee and the Management Compensation Committee of the Board, effective January 28, 2015. Also on that date, the Board approved a grant to Mr. Thulin of 707 restricted stock units, which is a prorated grant of the annual restricted stock unit award granted to non-employee Directors under the Chevron Non-Employee Directors' Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan. Mr. Thulin will also be entitled to receive the annual cash retainer for non-employee Directors, which will be prorated and paid in monthly installments of $12,500. The press release announcing Mr. Thulin's election is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. (e) On January 28, 2015, the independent Directors of the Chevron Corporation (""Chevron"") Board of Directors (""Board"") approved the grant of 662,000 stock options and 59,100 performance shares to J.S. Watson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and ratified the following grants by the Management Compensation Committee under the Long Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (""LTIP""): G.L. Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President, 280,800 stock options and 25,100 performance shares; R.H. Pate, Vice President and General Counsel, 125,300 stock options, 11,200 performance shares, and 11,180 restricted stock units; M.K. Wirth, Executive Vice President, 164,600 stock options, 14,700 performance shares, and 14,700 restricted stock units; and P.E. Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 164,600 stock options and 14,700 performance shares. The stock options have a ten year term, and one-third of the grant vests at each anniversary of the date of grant, except as described below in the last paragraph. The exercise price for the stock options is $103.71 per share, which is based on the closing price of Chevron's common stock on January 28, 2015, the date of grant. The number of stock options granted was determined based on grant date inputs including stock price and Black-Scholes valuation. The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (TSR) for the performance period as compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's LTIP Performance Share Peer Group (BP p.l.c., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c. and Total S.A.). The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's peer group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the peer group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the modifier will be the average of the sum of all the modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the peer group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The Management Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. The restricted stock units vest on January 28, 2018, payout in cash based on the closing price of Chevron common stock on the date of vesting (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and do not accrue dividend equivalents. Since Mr. Watson, Mr. Kirkland, and Ms. Yarrington each has more than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 28, 2015 date of grant will vest upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules. Since Mr. Wirth has more than 75 points but less than 90 points under the LTIP, all unvested outstanding stock options and performance shares held for at least one year from the January 28, 2015 date of grant will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the options grant date (or, for performance shares, the performance period start date) to the separation from service date, up to 36 months, divided by 36 months) upon the separation from service for any reason other than for cause as defined under the LTIP rules.

887,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2015. Purchase Agreement On January 29, 2015, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Micron"" or the ""Company""), entered into a purchase agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives (the ""Representatives"") of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the ""Initial Purchasers""), to issue and sell $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2023 (the ""Notes"") in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for the retirement or repurchase of convertible notes and debt and general corporate purposes. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company together with customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities. The Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the foregoing transaction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Purchase Agreement. Indenture The Notes are governed by an indenture (the ""Indenture""), dated as of February 3, 2015, by and between Micron and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""Trustee""). The Notes mature on August 1, 2023, and interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 5.25% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2015. Prior to February 1, 2018, Micron may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a ""make-whole"" premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. On or after February 1, 2018, Micron may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at specified prices that decline over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, Micron may use the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes prior to February 1, 2018 at a price equal to 105.25% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If Micron experiences specified change of control triggering events, Micron must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Micron and/or its domestic restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which Micron owns at least 80% of the voting stock) to: create or incur certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; and consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the Indenture. The following events are considered events of default under the Indenture: Micron's failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on any Note when due at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; Micron's failure to pay interest, including any additional interest, on any of the Notes for 30 days after the date when due; Micron's failure to give timely notice of specified change of control triggering events, which failure continues for a period of 30 days; the failure by Micron or any of its subsidiaries to comply with any other agreement under the Indenture for a period of 90 days after receiving notice of such failure from the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes as required by the Indenture; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to Micron or any of its significant subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) which specified events shall not include (i) certain events under the laws of jurisdictions other than the laws of the jurisdiction of such person's incorporation or organization or the jurisdiction of its head office or jurisdictions in which all or substantially all of such person's assets are located, and (ii) specified events with respect to any such person as a result of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceedings that were ongoing or in process at the time such person became a subsidiary or any related proceedings (including alternate proceedings) or other such proceedings that are in the nature of either a continuation or extension thereof. If an event of default described in the last bullet point above occurs and is continuing with respect to Micron, then the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Notes will automatically become due and immediately payable without any further action or notice. If any other event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, then either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Notes due and immediately payable. The description of the Notes and the Indenture contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Indenture and the form of note included in the Indenture, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Registration Rights Agreement In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Micron also entered into a registration rights agreement, dated February 3, 2015, with the Representatives (the ""Registration Rights Agreement""). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, if any Notes are not freely transferable by holders (other than holders that are affiliates of Micron or that were affiliates of Micron within the preceding three months) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act within 366 days after their original issuance, Micron is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes (the ""Exchange Notes"") with terms identical to the Notes (except that the Exchange Notes will not be subject to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate and interest thereon shall accrue from the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes or, if no such interest has been paid, from February 3, 2015).

The Supply Agreements provide that, during their respective terms, Inotera will sell to Micron all of the DRAM products manufactured by Inotera. Under the 2015 Supply Agreement, the price for DRAM products sold to Micron is based on a discount from market prices and is determined in a manner generally consistent with the Existing Supply Agreement.

The formula takes into account each party's costs of manufacture as well as Micron's consolidated operating expense ratio and Micron's worldwide revenue per wafer on a per-node basis. The 2016 Supply Agreement has an initial two-year term, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions. If the parties do not agree to any given extension, the 2016 Supply Agreement provides that it would terminate following the end of the then-existing term and a subsequent three-year wind-down period. Each party has the right to terminate the Supply Agreements upon certain material breaches by the other party, and Micron has the right to terminate the Supply Agreements if certain events occur, including, among others, Inotera's bankruptcy, reorganization or similar events relating to Inotera. In the event the 2015 Supply Agreement is terminated prior to the end of its term, the 2016 Supply Agreement will terminate and will not become effective.

895,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2015. On February 12, 2015, Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte. Ltd. (the ""Borrower""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron""), entered into a Facility Agreement with The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (""HSBC""), DBS Bank, Ltd. (""DBS""), ING Bank N.V. (""ING"") and Standard Chartered Bank (""SCB""), as mandated lead arrangers, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (""OCBC""), as an arranger, HSBC as facility agent, security agent and account bank, and HSBC, DBS, ING, SCB, OCBC, BNP Paribas, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and United Overseas Bank Limited, as original lenders (the ""Facility Agreement""). The Facility Agreement provides the Borrower with a committed $750 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""). The Facility Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances (including the agreement of financial institutions in their sole discretion to provide additional commitments), the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the Facility Agreement may be increased at the Borrower's request. As of the date of the filing of this Current Report there are no borrowings outstanding under the Facility Agreement. The obligations of the Borrower under the Facility Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Micron pursuant to a Guaranty entered into by Micron on February 12, 2015. Proceeds of borrowings under the Facility Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The Borrower's obligations under the Facility Agreement are secured by all of the Borrower's accounts receivables. The Credit Facility matures on February 12, 2020 (the ""Maturity Date""). The Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Facility Agreement prior to the Maturity Date, subject to the borrowing base described below. The Borrower must repay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the Facility Agreement, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, on the Maturity Date. Availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility from time to time is subject to a borrowing base equal to 80% of the Borrower's eligible accounts receivable. The borrowing base is further reduced by required dilution reserves and may be further reduced by amounts in excess of obligor concentration limits. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus an additional interest rate margin that is determined by the average availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility. The additional interest rate margin for borrowings ranges from 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, with the applicable margin varying depending upon the utilized portion of the Credit Facility. In addition, the Borrower will pay a commitment fee on the undrawn commitments under the Credit Facility from time to time at a rate of 0.25% to 0.375%, with the applicable rate varying depending on the utilized portion of the Credit Facility. The Facility Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and early amortization events and events of default that are customary for credit agreements of this type, including as funding conditions, the absence of any early amortization event, the absence of any default, and the absence of any event or circumstance that has a material adverse effect on the Borrower's operations, assets, prospects, business or condition, and including negative covenants that limit or restrict the Borrower's ability to create liens on, or dispose of, the collateral securing the obligations under the Facility Agreement. The Facility Agreement does not contain financial covenants and does not contain any covenant restricting the payment of dividends or the making of other restricted payments by the Borrower or Micron. Early amortization events under the Facility Agreement include, among others, the following (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods): breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the Facility Agreement and related transaction documents (other than breaches relating to payment defaults), Micron ceasing to own more than 50% of the equity of the Borrower, failure of any collateral documents or security documents or guarantee or indemnity to be in effect/enforceable, or to create fully perfected security with the ranking and priority which it is expressed to have, and breaches of requirements related to the collection account. In the event an early amortization event is continuing, the facility agent and the security agent shall, if directed by the lenders holding a majority of the principal amount of commitments, (i) apply certain amounts of the secured accounts receivables towards amortization of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, and (ii) terminate the portion of the Credit Facility that has been amortized. Events of default under the Facility Agreement include, among others, the following (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods): nonpayment of principal, interest or any other amount due under the Credit Facility, occurrence of an early amortization event that has not resulted in the repayment of all of the Borrower's obligations under the Facility Agreement within 120 days, acceleration of indebtedness of the Borrower in excess of $100 million, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency with respect to the Borrower or Micron. If an event of default is continuing, the facility agent may, if directed by the lenders holding a majority of the principal amount of commitments, (i) terminate the obligations of the lenders to make loans, (ii) declare the obligations outstanding under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and/or (iii) exercise legal and contractual rights and remedies. The lenders under the Facility Agreement and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Micron, the Borrower or their affiliates, including the provision of investment banking, commercial banking and cash management services, foreign exchange hedging and equipment financing and leasing services.

The Company may borrow from time to time up to $2,000,000,000 in revolving credit loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement matures on April 10, 2020, with one-year extension options subject to certain conditions, including certain lender approvals. Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement will bear interest at the Company's option at either LIBOR or ABR plus an interest margin. ABR is the greatest of the (a) Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1 percent per annum and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1 percent per annum. The applicable interest margin will be based on the Company's long-term, senior unsecured corporate credit ratings from Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement). Based on the Company's current credit ratings and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, any Eurodollar Loans and Multicurrency Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.300 percent (compared to LIBOR plus 1.275 percent under the 2012 Facility), and any ABR Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement bear interest at ABR plus 0.300 percent (compared to ABR plus 0.275 percent under the 2012 Facility). In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee of 0.200 percent per year (compared to 0.225 percent per year under the 2012 Facility), based on the Company's credit ratings, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the total amount of revolving credit commitments (generally irrespective of usage) under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x for the first four fiscal quarter-ends following the closing of the Company's proposed acquisition of the American Medical Systems urology portfolio (the ""Acquisition""), and decreasing to 4.25x, 4.0x, and 3.75x for the next three fiscal quarter-ends after such four fiscal quarter-ends, respectively, and then to 3.5x for each fiscal quarter-end thereafter. The ratios are calculated based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted pursuant to the 2015 Credit Agreement (""Consolidated EBITDA""). The Company is permitted to exclude from Consolidated EBITDA any Non-Cash Charges (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) and any Cash Litigation Payments (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement), and will be permitted to exclude from Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments, provided that the sum of any excluded Cash Litigation Payments and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments shall not exceed $2,000,000,000 in the aggregate. In addition, the Company may exclude from Consolidated EBITDA any cash and non-cash charges with respect to restructurings, plant closings, staff reductions, distributor network optimization initiatives, distribution technology optimization initiatives or other similar charges, provided that the aggregate amount of all such charges shall not exceed $620,000,000.

Simultaneously with its entry into the 2015 Credit Agreement, the Company entered into certain other financing arrangements in connection with the Company's proposed Acquisition. $750 Million Term Loan Facility and $250 Million Revolving Credit Facility On April 10, 2015, the Company entered into a $750,000,000 unsecured term loan credit facility (the ""New Term Loan Facility""), by and among the Company, as Borrower, the several lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. This New Term Loan Facility matures on April 10, 2020 and will be used to fund the Acquisition, including the payment of fees and expenses. The Acquisition is expected to close before the end of the third quarter of 2015, subject to receipt of applicable regulatory clearances and satisfaction of other customary conditions. The New Term Loan Facility will only be funded if the Acquisition closes. On the same day, the Company also entered into a $250,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, by and among the Company, as Borrower, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the ""New Revolving Facility"" and together with the New Term Loan Facility, the ""Additional Credit Agreements""). The New Revolving Facility will be used to finance working capital and for the general corporate needs of the Company and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to acquisitions and will mature on October 13, 2015. Commitment amounts under the New Revolving Facility may be reduced by certain debt and equity issuances occurring prior to the maturity date. The New Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments in the amount of 5% of the aggregate initial principal commencing on the first fiscal quarter ended after the date which is the second anniversary of the Acquisition closing date. Loans under the Additional Credit Agreements will each bear interest at the Company's option at either LIBOR or ABR plus an interest margin. The applicable interest margin will be based on the Company's long-term, senior unsecured, corporate credit ratings from Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investor Service Inc., and Standard & Poor's Rating Services and the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Additional Credit Agreements, respectively). Based on the Company's current credit ratings and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, (i) any borrowings under the New Term Loan Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.500 percent or ABR plus 0.500 percent and an undrawn fee of 0.200 percent per year that accrues from 60 days after the closing date through the date of funding under the New Term Loan Facility, and (ii) any borrowings under the New Revolving Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.325 percent or ABR plus 0.325 percent. The Company will pay a facility fee on the New Revolving Facility of 0.175 percent per year, based on the Company's credit ratings. In addition, the Company is required to pay certain other fees under the Additional Credit Agreements based on the Company's credit ratings and Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Additional Credit Agreements contain covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio substantially similar to the ratios in the 2015 Credit Facility.

951,MU,"       Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on December 14, 2015. On December 14, 2015 (the ""Effective Date""), Micron Technology B.V. (""Micron BV""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron Technology, Inc. (""Micron""), and Micron BV's newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Micron Semiconductor Taiwan Co. Ltd. (""Buyer"") entered into a Framework Agreement (the ""Framework Agreement"") with Inotera Memories, Inc. (""Inotera""), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Framework Agreement, Buyer will implement a 100% share swap pursuant to Article 29 of the Republic of China Mergers and Acquisitions Act and thereby acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Inotera (such transaction, the ""Share Swap""). Inotera is a Taiwan-based company that presently manufactures DRAM products and sells such products exclusively to Micron. Micron, indirectly through two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, holds 32.68% of the issued and outstanding Inotera shares, Nanya Technology Corporation (""NTC"") and certain of its affiliates together hold 31.97% of the issued and outstanding Inotera shares, and the remaining issued and outstanding Inotera shares are publicly held. Upon consummation of the Share Swap, each issued and outstanding Inotera share will represent the right to receive from Buyer 30 New Taiwan dollars (""NT$"") in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement. Micron estimates that the aggregate consideration payable in the Share Swap for Inotera shares not already owned by Micron or its subsidiaries will be approximately $4.1 billion (which is expected to be approximately $3.2 billion net of cash and debt at Inotera). The Framework Agreement provides that Micron BV, Buyer and Inotera will cooperate in good faith to negotiate and enter into, within 60 days following the Effective Date, a further definitive agreement to govern the Share Swap (a ""Definitive Share Swap Agreement""). Either Buyer or Inotera may terminate the Framework Agreement if Micron BV, Buyer and Inotera do not enter into a Definitive Share Swap Agreement within such 60-day period. Unless and until Micron BV, Buyer and Inotera enter into a Definitive Share Swap Agreement or the Framework Agreement is terminated, the Framework Agreement will remain in effect and govern the Share Swap. Under the Framework Agreement, the consummation of the Share Swap is subject to various conditions, including but not limited to: (1) the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals from authorities in Taiwan; (2) the adoption and approval of the Framework Agreement and the Share Swap by the shareholders of Inotera in accordance with applicable law (the ""Inotera Shareholder Approval""), which requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the issued and outstanding Inotera shares (including such shares held by Micron and its subsidiaries and by NTC and its affiliates); (3) the consummation and funding of debt financing, on terms satisfactory to Buyer or its designee, resulting in aggregate proceeds to Buyer or its designee of at least NT$80 billion to fund the Share Swap (the ""Debt Financing""); and (4) unless Micron determines otherwise, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement described below. In addition to the termination rights described above that apply if Micron BV, Buyer and Inotera do not enter into a Definitive Share Swap Agreement within 60 days following the Effective Date, the Framework Agreement contains, among others, termination rights pursuant to which the Framework Agreement may be terminated: (1) by either Buyer or Inotera if the Share Swap has not occurred by November 30, 2016; (2) by Buyer if Buyer or its designee has not obtained debt commitment letters for the Debt Financing by May 1, 2016; (3) by Buyer if, at any time prior to the Inotera Shareholder Approval, NTC or any of its affiliates breaches any voting and support agreement with Micron BV and Buyer relating to the Share Swap or if any such voting and support agreement is no longer in effect; or (4) by Buyer if certain affiliates of NTC have not signed such voting and support agreements by December 23, 2015. Consummation of the Share Swap is currently expected to occur in the middle of 2016. On the Effective Date, Micron BV, Buyer and Micron also entered into the following agreements in connection with the Share Swap: Voting and Support Agreement Micron BV and Buyer entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the ""Voting and Support Agreement"") with NTC, pursuant to which NTC has agreed, subject to applicable law, to (1) cause its representatives on the board of directors of Inotera to vote in favor of and approve proposed board actions relevant to the Share Swap and (2) vote its Inotera shares in favor of and approve shareholder actions relevant to the Share Swap. Pursuant to the Voting and Support Agreement, NTC has further agreed not to transfer any of its Inotera shares so long as the Voting and Support Agreement is in effect. The Voting and Support Agreement will terminate automatically upon (1) the termination of the Framework Agreement (unless such termination is in connection with the execution of a Definitive Share Swap Agreement) or (2) if Micron BV, Buyer and Inotera enter into a Definitive Share Swap Agreement, the termination of the Definitive Share Swap Agreement. Share Purchase Agreement Micron entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the ""Share Purchase Agreement"") with NTC, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Share Purchase Agreement, Micron has the option to issue shares of Micron common stock (the ""Micron Shares"") to NTC in an amount that will result in proceeds to Micron of up to NT$31.5 billion. The per share purchase price for the Micron Shares in any such issuance will be equal to the NT$ equivalent of the average of the closing sale price of one share of Micron common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the thirtieth (30th) trading day prior to the consummation of the Share Swap. Any proceeds from the issuance of Micron Shares will be used to fund a portion of the consideration payable in the Share Swap. Micron's offer and sale of the Micron Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement will be conducted as a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

(e) On January 27, 2016, the independent Directors of the Chevron Corporation (""Chevron"") Board of Directors (""Board"") approved the grant of 964,800 stock options and 73,600 performance shares to J.S. Watson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and ratified the following grants by the Management Compensation Committee under the Long Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (""LTIP"") to the principal financial officer and the other named executive officers identified in Chevron's most recent proxy statement: R.H. Pate, Vice President and General Counsel, 182,600 stock options and 13,900 performance shares; M.K. Wirth, Executive Vice President, 239,900 stock options, 18,300 performance shares, and 18,300 restricted stock units; and P.E. Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 239,900 stock options and 18,300 performance shares.      The stock options have a ten-year term, and one-third of the grant vests at each anniversary of the date of grant, except as described below in the last paragraph. The exercise price for the stock options is $83.29 per share, the closing price of Chevron's common stock on January 27, 2016, the date of grant. The number of stock options granted was determined based on grant date inputs including stock price and Black-Scholes valuation.      The performance shares may result in a cash pay out at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (""TSR"") for the performance period as compared to the TSR of each company in Chevron's LTIP Performance Share Peer Group (BP p.l.c., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c., and Total S.A.). The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares granted multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year period compared to the TSR of each company in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 150 percent, 100 percent, 50 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower member of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the performance modifier will be the average of the sum of all the performance modifiers for Chevron and for such other members of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The Management Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment.      The restricted stock units vest on January 27, 2019, will pay out in cash based on the closing price of Chevron common stock on the date of vesting (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and do not accrue dividend equivalents. Under the LTIP, if a participant is separated from service for any reason prior to the vesting date of the restricted stock units, the restricted stock units will be forfeited.      Under the LTIP, if these individuals are separated from service for any reason prior to the first anniversary of the January 27, 2016 date of grant, the above-described stock option and performance share awards will be forfeited. Since Ms. Yarrington and Mr. Watson each have 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP and Mr. Wirth will have 90 points as of the first anniversary of the January 27, 2016 date of grant, on that date the unvested portion of the above-described stock option and performance share awards will vest upon the separation from service on or after that date for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the LTIP rules). Since      Mr. Pate will have less than 75 points under the LTIP as of the first anniversary of the January 27, 2016 date of grant, the unvested portion of the above-described stock option and performance share awards will be forfeited if Mr. Pate is separated from service for any reason prior to August 1, 2019. Pursuant to an agreement between Chevron and Mr. Pate, filed as Exhibit 10.16 to Chevron's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, if Mr. Pate is separated from service for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the LTIP rules) on or after August 1, 2019, he will be treated as if he had 75 points under the LTIP and the unvested portion of the above-described stock option and performance share awards will vest on a pro rata basis (the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the options grant date (or, for performance shares, the performance period start date) to the separation from service date, up to 36 months, divided by 36 months).

The Definitive Share Swap Agreement contains, among others, termination rights pursuant to which it may be terminated: (1) by either Buyer or Inotera if the Share Swap has not occurred by November 30, 2016 (subject to the right of Micron BV and Buyer to extend such date by 90 days if all conditions other than the condition relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement have been satisfied); (2) by Buyer if Buyer or its designee has not obtained debt commitment letters for the Debt Financing by May 1, 2016; or (3) by Buyer if, at any time prior to the Inotera Shareholder Approval, NTC or any of its affiliates breaches any voting and support agreement with Micron BV and Buyer relating to the Share Swap or if any such voting and support agreement is no longer in effect.      Consummation of the Share Swap is currently expected to occur in the middle of 2016.

Indenture      On April 26, 2016, Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Micron""), issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the ""Notes"") in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are governed by an indenture (the ""Indenture""), dated as of April 26, 2016, by and among Micron, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""Trustee"") and collateral agent (the ""Collateral Agent""). The Notes mature on September 15, 2023, and interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 7.500% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2016.      Prior to April 15, 2019, Micron may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a ""make-whole"" premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. On or after April 15, 2019, Micron may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at specified prices that decline over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, Micron may use the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes prior to April 15, 2019 at a price equal to 107.500% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.      The Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each domestic restricted subsidiary of Micron (which is generally any domestic subsidiary in which Micron owns at least 80% of the voting stock) that creates, incurs, guarantees or otherwise becomes liable for any indebtedness not otherwise permitted under the Indenture, unless such domestic restricted subsidiary becomes a guarantor of the Notes. Pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2016, by and among Micron, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto, and the Collateral Agent (the ""Security Agreement""), the Notes and the guarantees will be secured by a first-priority lien, subject to certain exceptions, which will be pari passu with the lien securing Micron's obligations under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), on substantially all of Micron and the guarantors' domestic assets.      If Micron experiences specified change of control triggering events, Micron must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.      The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Micron and/or its domestic restricted subsidiaries to:      create or incur certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions;      in the case of Micron's domestic restricted subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; and      in the case of Micron, consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its and its restricted subsidiaries', taken as a whole, assets, to another person.      These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the Indenture.      The following events are considered events of default under the Indenture:      Micron's failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on any of the Notes when due at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise;      Micron's failure to pay interest, including any additional interest, on any of the Notes for 30 days after the date when due;      Micron's failure to give timely notice of specified change of control triggering events, which failure continues for a period of 30 days;      the failure by Micron or any of its subsidiaries to comply with any other agreement under the Indenture for a period of 90 days after receiving notice of such failure from the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes as required by the Indenture;      certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to Micron or any of its significant subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) which specified events shall not include (i) certain events under the laws of jurisdictions other than the laws of the jurisdiction of such person's incorporation or organization or the jurisdiction of its head      office or jurisdictions in which all or substantially all of such person's assets are located, and (ii) specified events with respect to any such person as a result of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceedings that were ongoing or in process at the time such person became a subsidiary or any related proceedings (including alternate proceedings) or other such proceedings that are in the nature of either a continuation or extension thereof;      Micron's default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced certain indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or any additional pari passu agreement (as defined in the Indenture), whether such indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or such default is with respect to another obligation under such indebtedness and results in the holder or holders of such indebtedness causing the payment of such indebtedness to be accelerated and to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness not so paid when due, or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $100.0 million or more;      any of the security documents evidencing the holders of the Notes' lien upon the collateral securing the Notes shall cease, for any reason, to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with its terms) with respect to collateral with a book value greater than $150.0 million, or Micron or any guarantor shall so assert, or any lien (affecting collateral with a book value greater than $150.0 million) created by such security documents shall cease to be enforceable and of the same effect and priority purported to be created thereby (other than, in each case, pursuant to a failure of the Collateral Agent, any other agent appointed by the Collateral Agent or the Trustee to maintain possession over possessory collateral actually received by it) (it being understood that the release of collateral from such security documents pursuant to their terms or the discharge of a guarantor of the Notes therefrom shall not be construed (x) as any of such security documents ceasing to be in full force and effect or (y) as any of the liens created thereunder ceasing to be enforceable or of the same priority and effect purported to be created thereby) and such default continues for 60 calendar days after either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have given Micron written notice of the Default; and      except as permitted by the Indenture, any guarantee of the Notes provided by a significant subsidiary ceases, for any reason, to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with its terms), or any significant subsidiary that is a guarantor of the Notes denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its guarantee of the Notes.      If an event of default described in the fifth bullet point above occurs and is continuing with respect to Micron, then the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Notes will automatically become due and immediately payable without any further action or notice. If any other event of default under the applicable Indenture occurs and is continuing, then either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Notes due and immediately payable.

The proxy access amendment would give stockholders the right to include their director nominees in Oracle's proxy statement based on a ""3/3/20/20"" structure, under which eligible stockholders could use proxy access to nominate up to 20% of the Board (but in any event at least two directors). To do so, stockholders would be required to have held shares comprising at least 3% of Oracle's outstanding shares continuously for at least three years. In addition, the proposed amendment would allow up to 20 stockholders to form a group to reach the required ownership threshold.      In requesting a bylaw taking this approach, the Board considered the stockholder vote on a proxy access proposal at Oracle's 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, as well as a variety of views on proxy access, including the Council of Institutional Investors' Proxy Access Best Practices, and those gained through extensive discussions with stockholders and independent advisors with expertise in this area.

On May 26, 2016, General Motors Company (""GM"" ""we"", ""our"" or the ""Company"") amended and restated its two existing revolving credit facilities (together the ""Facilities"") to increase aggregate borrowing capacity to $14.5 billion with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, and a syndicate of 44 lenders. These Facilities amend and restate the $12.5 billion revolving credit facilities that we entered into in October 2014. The Facilities consist of a three-year, $4.0 billion facility and a five-year, $10.5 billion facility. These Facilities are unsecured and provide additional liquidity.      The three-year, $4.0 billion facility is available to GM as well as certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including General Motors Financial Company, Inc., our captive finance company (""GM Financial""). This facility allows for borrowing in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of $1.0 billion, a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.0 billion and a Brazilian Real sub-facility of $0.3 billion. The five-year, $10.5 billion facility is available to GM as well as certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GM Financial. This facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of $3.0 billion, a letter of credit sub-limit of up to $0.5 billion and a Brazilian Real borrowing sub-facility of $0.2 billion.      Additionally, subject to compliance with certain covenants, we can increase borrowing capacity under the Facilities up to $18 billion, in the aggregate.      The Company has guaranteed the obligations of subsidiary borrowers under the Facilities. If GM fails to maintain an investment grade corporate rating from at least two of the following credit rating agencies: Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, we will also be required to provide guarantees from certain domestic subsidiaries under the terms of the Facilities.      Interest rates on obligations under the Facilities are based on prevailing annual interest rates for Eurodollar loans or an alternative base rate, both subject to an applicable margin. This applicable margin will be based upon the credit rating assigned to the Facilities.      The Facilities contain representations, warranties and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities. These covenants include restrictions on mergers or sales of assets and secured debt borrowings, subject to exceptions and limitations. The Facilities also require us to maintain at least $4.0 billion in global liquidity and at least $2.0 billion in U.S. liquidity.      Some of the lenders under the Facilities and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, trust and leasing services, and foreign exchange and other derivative arrangements.

1023,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Exit or Disposal Activities - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on June 06, 2016.        On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved, and the Company committed to, a 2016 Restructuring Program (the ""Program""). The Program is intended to develop global commercialization, technology and manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets, build on the Company's Plant Network Optimization (PNO) strategy and expand operational efficiencies in support of the Company's operating income margin goals. Key activities under the Program include strengthening global infrastructure through evolving global real estate and workplaces, developing global commercial and technical competencies, enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions, and continuing implementation of the Company's ongoing PNO strategy, which is intended to simplify the Company's manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities.      These activities are expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2016 and substantially completed by the end of 2018. The Company estimates that the Program will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized, and expects a portion of the Program savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.      While the Company expects some employee attrition and targeted headcount reductions to result from these restructuring initiatives, the Company anticipates that its overall employee base will remain relatively unchanged once this restructuring program is completed, as new jobs are created in areas of growth and resources are deployed to support an expanding portfolio and growing global market needs.      The Company estimates that the implementation of the Program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million, of which approximately $160 million to $210 million is expected to result in future cash outlays. The following table provides a summary of the Company's estimates of costs associated with the Program by major type of cost:      Type of cost Total estimated amount expected to be incurred      Restructuring charges:      Termination benefits* $65 million to $80 million      Other (1) $15 million to $25 million      Restructuring-related expenses:      Other (2) $95 million to $120 million      $175 million to $225 million      * Plans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, and the Company will work with employee representative bodies where required under local laws.      (1) Consists primarily of consultant fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.      (2) Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, and costs to transfer product lines among facilities.      The Company estimates that during the second quarter of 2016, it will record approximately $45 million of pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related charges associated with the Program. The Company will record the remaining expenses throughout the duration of the Program when it identifies with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated and as other Program-related expenses are incurred.

The Offer and withdrawal rights expired as scheduled at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on June 9, 2016 (such date and time, the ""Expiration Time""). American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary, has advised that, as of the Expiration Time, 24,540,818 Shares had been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, representing approximately 84.9% of the aggregate number of then issued and outstanding Shares. In addition, the Company advised Purchaser that 1,221,323 Shares were subject to exercisable securities at the Expiration Time. Accordingly, the minimum tender condition to the Offer has been satisfied. As a result of the satisfaction of the foregoing condition and each of the other conditions to the Offer, Purchaser has accepted for payment all Shares that were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.      On June 10, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL""), Purchaser was merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the ""Merger""). Upon completion of the Merger, the Company became a subsidiary of Oracle.      At the effective time of, and as a result of, the Merger and pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any required tax withholding, other than (i) Shares held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Oracle, Parent, Purchaser or any subsidiary of the Company or (ii) Shares held by stockholders who properly exercised appraisal rights under the DGCL.      In addition, at the effective time of and as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, the unvested portion of any stock option or restricted stock unit of the Company (each, a ""Company Compensatory Award"") that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and that was then held by a person who was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, was assumed by Oracle and converted automatically at the effective time of the Merger into an option or restricted stock unit of Oracle, as the case may be, denominated in shares of common stock of Oracle and subject to terms and conditions substantially identical to those in effect at the effective time (each such assumed unvested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, an ""Assumed Company Award""). The number of shares of the common stock of Oracle subject to each such Assumed Company Award upon the assumption thereof at the effective time of the Merger was determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Assumed Company Award by a fraction (the ""Award Exchange Ratio""), the numerator of which is the Offer Price and the denominator of which is the average closing price of common stock of Oracle on the New York Stock Exchange over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the effective time of the Merger occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share). If any such Assumed Company Award had an exercise or purchase price per Share as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, then, at the effective time of the Merger, such Assumed Company Award had an exercise or purchase price per share of the common stock of Oracle, and such new exercise or purchase price was determined by dividing the prior exercise or purchase price per Share of such Assumed Company Award by the Award Exchange Ratio (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent).      Further, at the effective time of the Merger, the vested portion (including any portion that pursuant to its terms vested solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) of each Company Compensatory Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (each such vested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, a ""Cashed Out Compensatory Award"") was not assumed by Oracle and was, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, cancelled and extinguished and, in exchange for the Cashed Out Compensatory Award, each former holder of any such Cashed Out Compensatory Award was granted the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (y) the Offer Price less any per share exercise or purchase price of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the ""Compensatory Award Payments""). From and after the effective time of the Merger, any such      Cashed Out Compensatory Award was no longer exercisable or settleable in shares by the former holder of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award, but instead the holder was only entitled to the payment of the Compensatory Award Payment, if any; provided that any Cashed Out Compensatory Award that had an exercise or purchase price equal to or greater than the Offer Price was cancelled without any consideration therefor. The Compensatory Award Payments was paid as soon as practicable following the effective time of the Merger, without interest.      Further, at the effective time of the Merger, the unvested portion of each Company Compensatory Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and that was held by a person who was not an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such unvested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, a ""Terminated Compensatory Award"") was not assumed by Oracle and was, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, cancelled and extinguished for no consideration. From and after the effective time of the Merger, any such Terminated Compensatory Award was no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof or settleable in Shares.

1037,ORCL,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL) filed a Form 8K - Acquisition or Disposition of Assets - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on June 14, 2016.        The Offer and withdrawal rights expired as scheduled at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on June 13, 2016 (such date and time, the ""Expiration Time""). American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary, has advised that, as of the Expiration Time, 47,425,747 Shares had been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, representing approximately 87.8% of the aggregate number of then issued and outstanding Shares. In addition, the Company advised Purchaser that 2,837,978 Shares were subject to exercisable securities at the Expiration Time. Accordingly, the minimum tender condition to the Offer has been satisfied. As a result of the satisfaction of the foregoing condition and each of the other conditions to the Offer, Purchaser has accepted for payment all Shares that were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.      On June 14, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL""), Purchaser was merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the ""Merger""). Upon completion of the Merger, the Company became a subsidiary of Oracle.      At the effective time of, and as a result of, the Merger and pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any required tax withholding, other than (i) Shares held by the Company as treasury stock, by any subsidiary of the Company or by Oracle, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective subsidiaries or (ii) Shares held by stockholders who properly exercised appraisal rights under the DGCL.      In addition, at the effective time of and as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, the unvested portion of any stock option, restricted stock award or restricted stock unit of the Company (each, a ""Company Compensatory Award"") that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and that was then held by a person who was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, was assumed by Oracle and converted automatically at the effective time of the Merger into an option, restricted stock award or restricted stock unit of Oracle, as the case may be, denominated in shares of common stock of Oracle and subject to terms and conditions substantially identical to those in effect at the effective time of the Merger (each such assumed unvested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, an ""Assumed Company Award""). The number of shares of the common stock of Oracle subject to each such Assumed Company Award upon the assumption thereof at the effective time of the Merger was determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Assumed Company Award by a fraction (the ""Award Exchange Ratio""), the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of common stock of Oracle on the New York Stock Exchange over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the effective time of the Merger occurred (rounded down to the nearest whole share). If any such Assumed Company Award had an exercise or purchase price per Share as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, then, at the effective time of the Merger, such Assumed Company Award had an exercise or purchase price per share of the common stock of Oracle, and such new exercise or purchase price was determined by dividing the prior exercise or purchase price per Share of such Assumed Company Award by the Award Exchange Ratio (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent).      Further, at the effective time of the Merger, the vested portion (including any portion that pursuant to its terms vested solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) of each Company Compensatory Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (each such vested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, a ""Cashed Out Compensatory Award"") was not assumed by Oracle and was, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, cancelled and extinguished and, in exchange for the Cashed Out Compensatory Award, each former holder of any such Cashed Out Compensatory Award had the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (y) the Offer Price less any per share exercise or purchase price of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable thereunder      being referred to as the ""Compensatory Award Payments""). From and after the effective time of the Merger, any such Cashed Out Compensatory Award was no longer exercisable or settleable in shares by the former holder of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award, but instead the holder was only entitled to the payment of the Compensatory Award Payment; provided that any Cashed Out Compensatory Award in respect of a Company stock option that had an exercise or purchase price equal to or greater than the Offer Price was cancelled without any consideration therefor. The Compensatory Award Payments were paid as soon as practicable following the effective time of the Merger, without interest.      Further, at the effective time of the Merger, the unvested portion of each Company Compensatory Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and that was held by a person who was not an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such unvested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, a ""Terminated Compensatory Award"") was not assumed by Oracle and was, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, cancelled and extinguished for no consideration. From and after the effective time of the Merger, any such Terminated Compensatory Award was no longer exercisable by the former holder thereof or settleable in Shares.      The aggregate consideration paid by Oracle, Parent and Purchaser in the Offer and Merger was approximately $571,501,050.30, without giving effect to related transaction fees and expenses. Oracle, Parent and Purchaser funded the consideration paid to stockholders in the Offer and pursuant to the Merger through Oracle's internally available cash, cash from operations and cash from previous borrowings.      The foregoing summary description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which is included as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

1051,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) filed a Form 8K - Changes to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 11, 2016.        (a) On July 11, 2016, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Qualcomm Incorporated (the Company) amended and restated the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws) as follows:      Modifications to the Company's Existing Proxy Access Provisions      As previously disclosed, on December 7, 2015, the Board amended the Bylaws to implement proxy access, permitting a stockholder (or a group of up to 20 stockholders) that has owned at least 3% of the Company's stock for at least 3 years to include their own nominees for board membership in the Company's proxy materials (up to 20% of the Board).      Following discussions with and input from a number of the Company's institutional stockholders, on July 11, 2016, the Board amended the proxy access provisions. The principal amendments were to:      * Change the maximum number of stockholder nominees from 20% of the Board to the greater of two or 20% of the Board;      * Remove the clause which provided that a stockholder nominee whom the Board decides to nominate as one of its own nominees counts against the maximum number of stockholder nominees;      * Remove the requirement that each nominating stockholder provide a representation that it intends to hold its shares for at least one year following the annual meeting;      * Remove the clause that provided that a stockholder nominee who does not receive at least 25% support will be prohibited from being a stockholder nominee for the next two annual meetings; and      * Remove the clause which provided that each nominating stockholder who has one of its stockholder nominees elected to the Board may not nominate other candidates for the next two annual meetings.      New Exclusive Forum Provision      Also on July 11, 2016, the Board amended the Bylaws to add a new Article XVI (the Exclusive Forum Provision), which provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of any such breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or (v) any action asserting an ""internal corporate claim"" (as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL) shall be the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware; unless said court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in which case, the Superior Court for the State of Delaware).      If any action subject to the Exclusive Forum Provision is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the Exclusive Forum Provision and (ii) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in such action as agent for such stockholder.      The Board determined that adoption of the Exclusive Forum Provision is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for a number of reasons, including, among others: reducing the possibility of costly and duplicative multi-forum litigation; attempting to ensure that relevant litigation matters will be heard by courts with significant experience applying Delaware corporate law; and recent case law and statutory developments in Delaware, and case law developments in other jurisdictions, upholding the Board's authority to adopt such bylaw provisions and confirming their validity.      The foregoing summary of the Bylaws is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

1052,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 19, 2016.        On July 19, 2016, Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company""), entered into a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS"") intended to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed transfer pricing issues for Guidant Corporation's 2001 through 2006 tax years and the Company's 2006 and 2007 tax years currently before the United States Tax Court (the ""Tax Court""). The Stipulation of Settled Issues is contingent upon the IRS Office of Appeals (""IRS Appeals"") applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the Company's 2008 through 2010 tax years and, if applicable, review by the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation. For a description of the Company's transfer pricing dispute for the 2001 through 2010 tax years see Note J - Income Taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.      If finalized, the settlement would resolve substantially all aspects of the controversy before the Tax Court described above as well as the Company's transfer pricing issues before IRS Appeals. In addition, the Company believes the basis of the settlement provides a framework that can be consistently applied by the IRS to all of the Company's U.S. income tax returns filed subsequent to 2010.      If the settlement is finalized, the Company will make net tax payments to the IRS of approximately $275 million to resolve both the controversy before the Tax Court as well as the transfer pricing issues before IRS Appeals. In addition, the Company will pay interest on the net taxes due, accruing from the date the tax liability originated through the date of payment. Based on the contingencies to be satisfied before final resolution as well as the experiences of other companies in similar situations, the Company expects to remit all tax and interest payments resulting from this settlement to the IRS in the next 12 to 24 months. The Company does not expect to recognize any additional charges related to the resolution as the Company had previously recorded sufficient reserves with respect to this controversy. The Company does not expect to change its 2016 estimated annual effective tax rate as a result of the resolution.      FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like ""anticipate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""believe,"" ""plan,"" ""estimate,"" ""intend"" and similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and estimates using information available to us at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements addressing the proposed settlement with the IRS relating to the Company's transfer pricing dispute for the 2001 through 2007 tax years before the U.S. Tax Court and 2008 through 2010 tax years before the IRS Office of Appeals, including the proposed settlement terms, and the application by the IRS of the same settlement or framework to all the Company's U.S. income tax returns filed subsequent to 2010. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. In many cases, these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed in this document. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of its forward-looking statements.      Risks and uncertainties that may cause such differences include, among other things: the risk that the conditions precedent to the settlement are never met and the transfer pricing dispute is not settled with the IRS and the risk that the IRS may not consistently apply the terms of the settlement to all the Company's U.S. income tax returns filed subsequent to 2010. New risks and uncertainties may arise from time to time and are difficult to predict. All of these factors are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of them are beyond our control. For a further list and description of these and other important risks and uncertainties that may affect our future operations, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we may update in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q we have filed or will file hereafter.

1054,MU,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Modification to Shareholders Rights - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2016.        On July 20, 2016, the Board of Directors of Micron Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""Company""), declared a dividend of one right (each, a ""Right"") for each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the ""Common Stock""), of the Company outstanding at the close of business on August 1, 2016 (the ""Record Date""), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated as of July 20, 2016, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Rights Agent (the ""Rights Agreement""). The Rights Agreement is intended to avoid an ""ownership change"" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), and thereby preserve the current ability of the Company to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ""Tax Benefits"").      Prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by the shares of Common Stock held in book-entry form or, in the case of certificated shares, Common Stock certificates and will be transferred with the Common Stock, and the registered holders of the Common Stock will be deemed to be the registered holders of the Rights. After the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will mail separate certificates evidencing the Rights to each record holder of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and thereafter the Rights will be transferable separately from the Common Stock.      The ""Distribution Date"" means the close of business on the earlier of:      1. the tenth calendar day after the date of the first public announcement (including the filing of a report on Schedule 13D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (or any comparable or successor report)) that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an ""Acquiring Person"") has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more (or in the case of a Grandfathered Person (as defined below), has exceeded and is exceeding such Grandfathered Person's Grandfathered Percentage (as defined below) by 0.5% or more) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the ""Stock Acquisition Date""); and      2. the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of commencement by any person of, or after the date of the first public announcement of the intention of any person to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which could result in any person becoming the beneficial owner of 4.99% or more (or in the case of a Grandfathered Person, has exceeded and is exceeding such Grandfathered Person's Grandfathered Percentage by 0.5% or more) of the shares of Common Stock of the Company then outstanding.      For purposes of calculating percentage ownership under the Rights Agreement, ""outstanding shares"" of Common Stock include all of the shares of common stock actually issued and outstanding. Beneficial ownership is determined as provided in the Rights Agreement and generally includes, without limitation, any ownership of securities a Person would be deemed to actually or constructively own for purposes of Section 382 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, securities ""beneficially owned"" by any Person will include all of the shares of Common Stock that such Person would have had the right or obligation to acquire.      An Acquiring Person will not include the Company; any of its subsidiaries; any employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries; any person organized, appointed or established by the Company and holding shares of Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan; or any Grandfathered Person unless such person exceeds the Grandfathered Percentage by 0.5% or more.      ""Grandfathered Person"" means any person who or which is, as of the Record Date, the beneficial owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. Any Grandfathered Person who after the Record Date becomes the beneficial owner of less than 4.99% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding shall cease to be a Grandfathered Person.      ""Grandfathered Percentage"" means the percentage of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company that such Grandfathered Person beneficially owns as of the Record Date; provided that, in the event any Grandfathered Person shall sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any outstanding shares of Common Stock after the Record Date, the Grandfathered Percentage shall, subsequent to such sale, transfer or disposition, mean, with respect to such Grandfathered Person, the lesser of (a) the Grandfathered Percentage as in effect immediately prior to such sale, transfer or disposition or (b) the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company that such Grandfathered Person beneficially owns immediately following such sale, transfer or disposition.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person will become an Acquiring Person as a result of an acquisition of Common Stock by the Company or any of its subsidiaries which, by reducing the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares of Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned by such person to 4.99% or more (or in the case of a Grandfathered Person, increases such Grandfathered Person's Grandfathered Percentage by 0.5% or more) of the shares of Common Stock of the Company then outstanding unless such person thereafter becomes the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Common Stock of the Company, in which case such person will be deemed to be an Acquiring Person. An Acquiring Person will not include any person that the Board of Directors of the Company, in good faith, determines has inadvertently become an Acquiring Person if such person promptly divests a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such person would no longer be an Acquiring Person. In addition, the Rights Agreement provides that a person shall not become an Acquiring Person for purpose of the Rights Agreement in a transaction that the Board of Directors determines is exempt from the Rights Agreement, which determination shall be made in the sole and absolute discretion of the Board of Directors, upon request by any person prior to the date upon which such person would otherwise become an Acquiring Person, including, without limitation, if the Board of Directors determines that (i) neither the beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock by such person, directly or indirectly, as a result of such transaction nor any other aspect of such transaction would jeopardize or endanger the availability to the Company of the Tax Benefits or (ii) such transaction is otherwise in the best interests of the Company.      Prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be exercisable. After the Distribution Date, but prior to the time a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right will be exercisable to purchase, for $10.00 (the ""Purchase Price""), one-half of one share of Common Stock.      If any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons) will entitle the holder to purchase, for the Purchase Price, a number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.      If, after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (1) the Company is involved in a merger, consolidation or other business combination in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or its Common Stock is exchanged for other securities or (2) the Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries sells or otherwise transfers assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, then each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons) will entitle the holder to purchase, for the Purchase Price, a number of shares of common stock of the other party to such business combination or sale (or in certain circumstances, an affiliate) having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.      At any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, but before any person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange all or part of the Rights (other than the Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one-half of one share of Common Stock per Right.     ...This item was truncated.

1078,MU,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2016.        On October 11, 2016, Inotera and MSTW, as co-borrowers, entered into a Syndicated Loan Agreement (the ""Loan Agreement"") with Bank of Taiwan, as Facility Agent, Mega International Commercial Bank Co., Ltd. (""Mega Bank""), as Collateral Agent, Taiwan Business Bank, Ltd. (""Taiwan Business Bank""), as Document Management Agent, Bank of Taiwan, Mega Bank, Taiwan Business Bank, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, Land Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Taipei Branch, CTBC Bank Co., Ltd., Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Ltd. and Yuanta Commercial Bank, as the mandated lead arrangers and as lenders, and certain other financial institutions as additional lenders.      The Loan Agreement provides for a secured delayed single-draw term loan facility, with a maximum aggregate borrowing amount of NT$80 billion (approximately US$2.54 billion). Proceeds of the loan under the Loan Agreement will be used by MSTW to pay a portion of the consideration and any related transaction costs for the Share Swap and to provide working capital for Inotera. The indebtedness under the Loan Agreement will be secured by liens in certain assets, including, among other things, a real estate mortgage on Inotera's main production facility and site, a chattel mortgage over certain equipment of Inotera, a pledge of all of the stock of MSTW held by Micron BV and a pledge of approximately 80% of the stock of Inotera held by MSTW following the consummation of the Share Swap. In addition, payment of intercompany loans made by shareholders of Inotera and MSTW is generally required to be subordinated to repayment of the loan under the Loan Agreement, subject to certain permitted exceptions.      Inotera and MSTW will be co-borrowers under the Loan Agreement and jointly and severally liable for all indebtedness under the Loan Agreement upon the completion of the Share Swap. Micron will guarantee all of Inotera's and MSTW's obligations under the Loan Agreement.      Borrowings under the Loan Agreement can be made in a single draw on or prior to July 10, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent. Micron expects the amount of NT$80 billion under the Loan Agreement to be borrowed on or before December 6, 2016 which is the date that has been established by Inotera's board of directors as the date for the consummation of the Share Swap. The loan will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month or six month TAIBOR, at the option of MSTW and Inotera, plus a margin of 2.05% per annum, payable monthly in arrears.      Under the Loan Agreement, MSTW and/or Inotera are also obligated to pay upfront fees, agency fees and other closing fees customary for a credit facility of this size and type. The loan will mature 5 years from the date it is made and principal is payable in six equal semi-annual installments, commencing thirty months after such loan is made.      MSTW and/or Inotera may prepay the loan under the Loan Agreement, subject to the payment of customary funding breakage amounts. MSTW and Inotera are required to make a mandatory prepayment of the loan under the Loan Agreement with proceeds from certain dispositions of collateral securing the loan and certain proceeds of property insurance to the extent such proceeds are not permitted to be used for repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed collateral. Any such mandatory prepayments would be applied to the principal repayment installments on the loan in inverse order of maturity.      The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants which are customary for financings of this type, including covenants that limit or restrict: the ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the Loan Agreement, mergers involving MSTW and/or Inotera, loans or guarantees to third parties by Inotera and/or MSTW and MSTW's distribution of cash dividends (subject to satisfaction of certain financial conditions).      The material financial covenants, ratios or tests contained in the Loan Agreement are as follows:      * MSTW (on a consolidated basis) must maintain a ratio of total debts to EBITDA not higher than 5.50x in 2017 and 2018; and not higher than 4.50x through 2019 to 2021.      * MSTW (on a consolidated basis) must maintain tangible net worth of not less than NT$4 billion in 2017 and 2018; not less than NT$6.5 billion in 2019 and 2020; and not less than NT$12 billion from 2021.      * Micron (on a consolidated basis) must maintain a ratio of total debts to EBITDA not higher than 4.50x in 2016; not higher than 3.50x in 2017; not higher than 3.00x in 2018 and 2019; and not higher than 2.50x in 2020 and 2021.      * Micron (on a consolidated basis) must maintain tangible net worth not less than US$9 billion in 2016 and 2017; not less than US$12.5 billion in 2018 and 2019; and not less than US$16.5 billion in 2020 and 2021.      All references to years are to fiscal years of Micron and its subsidiaries. These financial covenants are tested semi-annually. If one or more of the required financial ratios is not maintained at the time the ratios are tested the interest rate on the loans outstanding under the Loan Agreement will be increased by 0.25% until the next semi-annual period for which all such required financial ratios are maintained. In addition, if MSTW fails to maintain a required financial ratio applicable to it for any semi-annual period, such failure will constitute an event of default under the Loan Agreement if such financial ratio is not maintained with respect to the next subsequent semi-annual testing period and such event of default could result in all obligations owing under the Loan Agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable. The failure of Micron to maintain a required financial ratio applicable to it will only result in an increase to the applicable interest rate and will not constitute an event of default under the Loan Agreement.      The Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default which could result in all obligations owing under the Loan Agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable. These events of default include: non-payment of obligations, non-performance of covenants and obligations, breaches of representations and warranties, acceleration of other material debt, bankruptcy or insolvency, suspension of business operations for more than 45 consecutive days, enforcement of security or other legal actions on collateral, and failure of the effectiveness of the security interest granted in the collateral.      Certain of the lenders under the Loan Agreement and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Micron or its affiliates, including the provision of investment banking, commercial banking and cash management services, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging and financing and leasing services.

Purchase Agreement      On October 27, 2016, Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. (""Buyer""), a private company with limited liability organized under the laws of The Netherlands and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated (""Qualcomm""), entered into a Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with NXP Semiconductors N.V., a public limited liability company organized under the laws of The Netherlands (""NXP"").      Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Buyer will commence a tender offer (the ""Offer"") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common shares, par value EUR 0.20 per share, of NXP (the ""NXP Shares"") at a price of $110.00 per NXP Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, but subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the ""Offer Price""). The Offer will initially remain open until the later of (a) 21 business days from the commencement date of the Offer and (b) the date that is six business days after the date of the EGM (as defined below), and may be extended in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.      Buyer's obligation to purchase NXP Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions, including (a) NXP Shares having been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (excluding NXP Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee prior to the expiration of the Offer) that represent, together with the shares then owned by Buyer and its affiliates, at least 95% of the then-outstanding NXP Shares (the ""Minimum Condition""); provided that (x) if River shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (the ""EGM"") to be held prior to the closing of the Offer (the ""Offer Closing""), approve certain resolutions related to the Asset Sale and the Liquidation (each as defined below), the Minimum Condition will be reduced to 80% and (y) Buyer, with NXP's prior written consent, can reduce the Minimum Condition to a percentage not less than 70%; (b) the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of the European Union, as amended, and the receipt of all other clearances or approvals under applicable antitrust laws (collectively, the ""Required Antitrust Approvals""); (c) the absence of any applicable law or order of a governmental authority prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (d) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of NXP contained in the Purchase Agreement (subject to certain materiality standards); (e) NXP's material compliance with its covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement; (f) there not having been a material adverse effect on NXP following the execution of the Purchase Agreement; (g) the adoption of resolutions at the EGM providing for the appointment of Buyer designees to the board of directors of NXP (the ""NXP Board""); and (h) the completion in all material respects of certain internal reorganization steps with respect to NXP and the disposition of certain non-core assets of NXP (the ""Pre-Closing Reorganization"").      The Purchase Agreement provides, among other things, that following the Offer Closing, Buyer may effectuate a corporate reorganization of NXP and its subsidiaries (a ""Post-Closing Reorganization""). If Buyer acquires less than 95% but at least 80% of the outstanding NXP Shares as of the Offer Closing (and the subsequent offering periods provided in the Purchase Agreement), the Post-Closing Reorganization will be undertaken by means of a sale of all of the assets of NXP to Buyer (the ""Asset Sale""), followed promptly by a liquidation of NXP (the ""Liquidation""). If Buyer acquires 95% or more of the outstanding NXP Shares as of the Offer Closing (and the subsequent offering periods provided in the Purchase Agreement), the Post-Closing Reorganization will be undertaken by means of the Asset Sale and, upon the closing of such Asset Sale, the commencement of a compulsory acquisition by Buyer of NXP Shares from any remaining minority NXP shareholders in accordance with Section 2:92a of the Dutch Civil Code (the ""Compulsory Acquisition""). The Asset Sale and the Liquidation are subject to approval by NXP's shareholders at the EGM. If Buyer commences the Liquidation, NXP will be dissolved in accordance with Section 2:19 of the Dutch Civil Code and all holders of NXP Shares who did not tender their NXP Shares in the Offer will receive, for each NXP Share then held, cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price (without interest, but subject to any applicable withholding taxes). If Buyer commences the Compulsory Acquisition, all holders of NXP Shares who did not tender their NXP Shares in the Offer will receive, for each NXP Share then held, cash in an amount determined by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals, which amount is expected to equal the Offer Price (along with interest accruing at the Dutch statutory interest rate from the date that Buyer acquires 95% of the outstanding NXP Shares until the date on which payment is made pursuant to the Compulsory Acquisition). It is expected that following the completion of the Offer and the Post-Closing Reorganization, NXP will no longer be a publicly traded company, the listing of the NXP Shares on the NASDAQ Stock Market (""NASDAQ"") will be terminated and the NXP Shares will be deregistered under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), resulting in the cessation of NXP's reporting obligations with respect to the NXP Shares thereunder.      The Purchase Agreement provides for the following treatment of the equity awards of NXP upon the payment by Buyer for all NXP Shares tendered as of the Offer Closing:      At the Offer Closing, each outstanding award of restricted stock units in respect of NXP Shares that are subject to only time-based vesting (each, a ""NXP RSU"") and restricted stock units in respect of NXP Shares that are subject, in whole or in part, to vesting based on the achievement of one or more performance goals (each, a ""NXP PSU""), which are either vested or vest solely as a result of the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, will be canceled in exchange for an amount in cash (without interest and subject to required withholding) equal to the product of (x) the Offer Price multiplied by (y) the total number of NXP Shares subject to such NXP RSU or NXP PSU, as applicable.      At the Offer Closing, each outstanding award of unvested NXP RSUs will be converted into an equity award subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting, acceleration, and forfeiture provisions) as immediately prior to the Offer Closing, with respect to a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Qualcomm (the ""Qualcomm Shares"") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the total number of NXP Shares subject to such NXP RSU multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. The ""Equity Award Adjustment Ratio"" is equal to (1) the Offer Price divided by (2) the average closing price of Qualcomm Shares on NASDAQ for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Offer Closing, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth.      At the Offer Closing, each outstanding award of unvested NXP PSUs will be converted into an equity award subject to the same terms and conditions (including time-based vesting, acceleration, and forfeiture provisions) as immediately prior to the Offer Closing, with respect to a number of Qualcomm Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the total number of NXP Shares subject to such NXP PSU multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. Any NXP PSUs that are so converted shall no longer be subject to any performance-based vesting conditions (but shall remain subject to any time- or service-based vesting conditions).      At the Offer Closing, each outstanding option granted by NXP to acquire NXP Shares (each, a ""NXP Option"") that is either vested or vests solely as a result of the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement will be canceled in exchange for an amount in cash (without interest, but subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the applicable per share exercise price of such NXP Option multiplied by (y) the number of NXP Shares subject to such NXP Option.     ...This item was truncated.

The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured delayed-draw term facility (the Term Loan Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion.

1098,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Changes in Company Executive Management - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2016.        (i) 2017 Annual Bonus Plan      On November 18, 2016, upon the recommendation of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the ""Compensation Committee""), the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved the Company's 2017 Annual Bonus Plan effective for the performance period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.      As part of the Company's overall compensation program, the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan provides an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel (including the Company's named executive officers meeting the eligibility criteria) based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. The 2017 Annual Bonus Plan is substantially similar to the Company's 2016 Annual Bonus Plan and provides:      for a single bonus pool (the ""Total Annual Bonus"") that will be based on the Company's performance measured against achievement of corporate-level performance metric goals for adjusted earnings per share and global sales on a constant currency basis (""Global sales"");      the Total Annual Bonus as operated (i) will be capped at 90% of the aggregate annual bonus pool target (the ""Aggregate Annual Target"") in the event that the performance for Global sales is below 97% of the Company's approved performance goal for that metric; and (ii) will have a ceiling of 150% and a floor of 50% of the Aggregate Annual Target, with the Board having discretion to terminate, suspend or modify the plan and to reduce the Total Annual Bonus based on the Company's performance relative to its quality objectives and performance of its quality systems;      the Total Annual Bonus will be allocated among corporate, global operations and each participating business, regional and country unit (each, a ""participating unit"") based on each participating unit's overall and relative performance measured against its achievement of that unit's predetermined ""Scorecard"" performance metrics and goals and taking into consideration, as appropriate, other factors; such allocation will be a percentage of the annual bonus pool target for each participating unit (representing the total target annual bonuses of all eligible employees for the year within that unit) (each such allocated amount, an ""Assigned Bonus Pool""); and      the Assigned Bonus Pool for each participating unit will then be allocated among all managers of plan participants within that participating unit. Such managers will then evaluate the performance of the participants under their management and determine, for each participant, the percentage (between 0% and 200%) of the participant's target annual bonus that will be used to determine the participant's bonus award.      Awards to certain executive officers under the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek reimbursement of a bonus award in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. The Company may also seek reimbursement of a bonus award if there is a restatement of the Company's financial results that would have reduced a previously granted bonus award's size or payment. The amount to be recouped would be the amount of any such reduction. Finally, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a bonus award, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply      to the bonus award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan was established.      This description of the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such plan. A copy of the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.      (ii) 2017 Performance Share Programs      On November 18, 2016, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the adoption of two performance share programs, the Boston Scientific Corporation 2017 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program (the ""2017 TSR PSP"") and the Boston Scientific Corporation 2017 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program (the ""2017 FCF PSP""). These programs are substantially similar to the performance share programs for 2016 and represent an important component of the overall mix of the Company's long-term incentive program. Under both programs, performance share awards will be granted, if the relevant program criteria are met, to the Company's executive officers in the form of deferred stock units issued under the Company's 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was previously approved by the Company's stockholders. Awards to certain executive officers under both programs are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek recovery of performance share units in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. In addition, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a performance share award, under the Dodd-Frank Act or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the performance share award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the performance share award was granted.      (A) 2017 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program      The purpose of the 2017 TSR PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by comparing the Total Shareholder Return (""TSR"") of the Company's common stock to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019 (the ""Performance Period""). The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 200% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's TSR rank. Performance share awards will vest only upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria set forth in the 2017 TSR PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability.      This description of the 2017 TSR PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2017 TSR PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.      (B) 2017 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program      The purpose of the 2017 FCF PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by providing incentives for the achievement of key business performance objectives critical to its success. Under the 2017 FCF PSP, performance will be measured by comparing the Company's free cash flow for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017 against its 2017 financial plan performance for free cash flow. The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 150% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's free cash flow as compared to its financial plan. Performance share awards will only vest      upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria (which includes a three-year service period) set forth in the 2017 FCF PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability.      This description of the 2017 FCF PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2017 FCF PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.

In connection with completion of the First Merger, vested options to purchase shares of St. Jude Medical common stock were deemed exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise and the net number of shares of St. Jude Medical common stock payable in respect thereto were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes, with any fractional Abbott common shares to be settled in cash. In addition, unvested options and restricted stock units in respect of St. Jude Medical common stock were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options and restricted stock units (as applicable) of substantially equivalent value, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.      Based on the closing price of $39.36 for an Abbott common share on the New York Stock Exchange on January 4, 2017, the aggregate implied value of the consideration paid in connection with the Mergers was approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares and approximately $13.6 billion in cash.

Following such review, the independent Directors of the Board approved an annual base salary of $1,863,500 for John S.

Wirth $906,200 75%      On January 25, 2017, the independent Directors of the Board also approved the grant of 250,000 stock options, 65,340 performance shares, and 32,670 restricted stock units to Mr. Watson and ratified the following grants by the Committee under the Long Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (""LTIP""): (i) Ms. Yarrington, 62,200 stock options, 16,250 performance shares, and 8,120 restricted stock units; (ii) Mr. Johnson, 80,800 stock options, 21,110 performance shares, and 10,560 restricted stock units; (iii) Mr. Pate, 47,300 stock options, 12,370 performance shares, and 6,180 restricted stock units; and (iv) Mr. Wirth, 80,800 stock options, 21,110 performance shares, and 10,560 restricted stock units. This resulted in an intended mix of 50% performance shares, 25% stock options and 25% restricted stock units granted to each recipient.      The stock options have a ten-year term, and one-third of the options grant vests on each of January 31, 2018, January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2020, except as described further herein. The exercise price for the stock options is $117.24 per share, the closing price of Chevron's common stock on January 25, 2017, the date of grant. The number of stock options granted was determined based on grant date inputs including stock price and Black-Scholes valuation.      The performance shares may result in a cash payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019) depending upon Chevron's Total Stockholder Return (""TSR"") for the performance period as compared to the TSR of the following Chevron's LTIP Performance Share Peer Group: BP p.l.c., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell p.l.c., Total S.A., and the S&P 500 Total Return Index. The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares granted multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the performance period multiplied by a performance modifier. The performance modifier is based on Chevron's TSR ranking for the three-year performance period compared to the TSR of each competitor in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group as follows (from best TSR to lowest TSR): 200 percent, 160 percent, 120 percent, 80 percent, 40 percent or zero percent. If the difference between Chevron's TSR and the TSR of any higher or lower competitor of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group is less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point), the results will be considered a tie, and the performance modifier will be the average of all of the performance modifiers for Chevron and for such other competitors of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group that fall less than one percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) higher or lower than Chevron. The performance shares will accrue dividend equivalents that will be reinvested as additional performance shares and will vest on December 31, 2019 subject to the payout modifier, except as described further herein. The Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment.      The restricted stock units were awarded under the form of standard restricted stock unit agreement approved by the Committee. The award vests on January 31, 2022, will pay out in cash based on the closing price of Chevron common stock on the date of vesting (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and will accrue dividend equivalents that will be reinvested as additional restricted stock units, except as described further herein.      Under the LTIP, if these individuals are separated from service for any reason prior to January 31, 2018, the above-described stock option, performance share and restricted stock unit awards will be forfeited. Since Mr. Watson, Ms. Yarrington, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wirth each have reached 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the LTIP, on January 31, 2018, the unvested portion of the above-described stock option and performance share awards will vest upon their separation from service on or after that date for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the LTIP rules). Further, the unvested portion of the above-described restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest upon their separation from service on or after January 31, 2018 for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the LTIP rules), but will not be paid out prior to January 31, 2022. Since Mr. Pate will have less than 75 points under the LTIP as of January 31, 2018, the unvested portion of the above-described stock option, performance share and restricted stock unit awards will be forfeited if Mr. Pate is separated from service for any reason prior to August 1, 2019. Pursuant to an agreement between Chevron and Mr. Pate, filed as Exhibit 10.16 to Chevron's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, if Mr. Pate is separated from service for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the LTIP rules) on or after August 1, 2019, he will be treated as if he had 75 points under the LTIP and the unvested portion of the above-described stock option, performance share and restricted stock unit awards will vest on a pro rata basis. For options and performance shares, this is calculated as the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the      options grant date (or, for performance shares, the performance period start date) to the separation from service date, up to 36 months, divided by 36 months). For restricted stock units, this is calculated as the number of granted shares underlying the award multiplied by the number of whole months from the restricted stock units grant date to the separation from service date, up to 60 months, divided by 60 months.      Effective January 25, 2017, the Committee approved new forms of award agreements to be used for the award of stock options, performance shares and restricted stock units under the LTIP on a going-forward basis to executive officers and other eligible employees of Chevron, including the awards to the named executive officers described above. Copies of such forms of award agreements are filed as exhibits hereto and are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

1125,CVX,"Chevron Corp. (CVX) filed a Form 8K - Other Events - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on January 25, 2017.        Chevron Corporation (""Chevron"" or ""the Company"") is providing this supplemental information to provide stockholders with further guidance concerning the changes to Chevron's executive compensation structure approved by the independent members of the Company's Board of Directors (""Board"") on January 25, 2017, which are described in the Form 8-K related to compensation also filed today.      Chevron reaffirms its commitment to its longstanding pay philosophy of tying compensation to the Company's performance so as to align the interests of our stockholders, the Company, and its employees. The compensation structure previously in effect reflected this philosophy and historically served the Company well, enjoying strong support from stockholders as reflected in the average 95% stockholder support in Say on Pay votes from 2011 to 2015. Following the challenging conditions of the recent industry downturn, however, a number of stockholders expressed concern about the alignment of the Company's compensation structure with stockholder interests, as reflected in the decreased 54% stockholder support in the 2016 Say on Pay vote.      Following the 2016 Say on Pay vote, the Company's Board and executives undertook an extensive effort to obtain specific feedback from stockholders. The Company held 25 meetings with stockholders representing approximately 36 percent of Chevron's outstanding stock. The Company's Lead Director, Dr. Ronald D. Sugar, and the Chairman of the Management Compensation Committee of the Board, Mr. Enrique Hernandez, Jr., personally participated in meetings with stockholders representing approximately 29 percent of Chevron's outstanding stock. Meetings were also held with important stakeholders in the governance field such as ISS and Glass Lewis. Having considered the information obtained through this process, the Company has taken significant steps to better align its executive compensation structure with best industry practices. These changes allow the Board to better ensure that executive compensation remains aligned with stockholder interests in each year and for the long term.      In summary, the changes will: (i) decrease the percentage of compensation awarded as stock options to reduce excessive volatility; (ii) expand the Long Term Incentive Plan (""LTIP"") peer group used to determine relative performance in its Performance Share awards to include the S&P 500 Total Return Index; (iii) strengthen accountability for project performance, capital stewardship and investment discipline through revisions to its annual Chevron Incentive Plan (""CIP"") key performance measures; (iv) further extend the vesting periods of LTIP awards; and (v) reinforce the link between executive compensation and long term performance by strengthening the stock ownership requirements for its CEO and other named executive officers.      The effects of these changes can be illustrated by a comparison of the compensation provided in the Company's 2016 Proxy Statement filed on April 7, 2016, with the compensation announced in the Form 8-K related to compensation filed today. For example, the independent members of the Board approved an annual base salary in 2017 for Chairman and CEO, Mr. John S. Watson, of $1,863,500, reflecting no increase from 2016. Pursuant to its new administration of the CIP, the independent members of the Board approved a 2016 CIP award of $2,096,400 compared to a target of $2,700,000 and a 2015 CIP award of $2,450,000. Further, pursuant to its new administration of the LTIP, the independent members of the Board approved a 2017 grant to Mr. Watson of 250,000 stock options, 65,340 performance shares, and 32,670 restricted stock units, compared to a 2016 award of 964,800 stock options and 73,600 performance shares, under the LTIP. These equity mix changes with respect to LTIP awards are intended, while keeping the target value of a given award constant, to decrease the percentage of compensation awarded as options, reducing volatility, and to further tie compensation to stockholder return by adding the S&P 500 Total Return Index as an additional competitor in the LTIP peer group for the purpose of assessing the Company's relative performance under a performance share award. While there is a change in the mix of equity award components, the target award value has remained constant between 2016 and 2017.

1135,GM,"General Motors Co. (GM) filed a Form 8K - Entry Into a Definitive Agreement - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on March 05, 2017.        On March 5, 2017, General Motors Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors Company (the ""Company"") and a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the ""Seller""), entered into a Master Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with PSA Group (the ""Purchaser""). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchaser will acquire the Company's Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the ""Opel/Vauxhall Business"") and, together with a financial partner, the Company's European financial subsidiaries and branches (the ""Fincos"" and, together with the Opel/Vauxhall Business, the ""Transferred Business""), including all of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries of the Company, certain minority interests and substantially all of the assets of the Company's subsidiary, Adam Opel AG, a German Aktiengesellschaft (""AOAG"").      The net consideration to be paid for the Opel/Vauxhall Business under the Agreement has an estimated value of approximately $1.2 billion ( 1.1 billion), consisting of (i) approximately $0.9 billion ( 891 million) in cash and (ii) warrants (valued at approximately $0.7 billion ( 649 million) based on recent trading prices of Purchaser's shares), less (iii) an approximately $0.4 billion ( 400 million) de-risking premium payment to the Purchaser for the assumption of certain underfunded pension liabilities by the Purchaser. The warrants are not exercisable for five years and do not include any governance or voting rights with respect to the Purchaser. In addition, the Company has agreed to sell the shares of the Purchaser received upon exercise of the warrants within 35 days after exercise. The net consideration to be paid for the Fincos will be 0.8 times their book value at closing, which the Company estimates will be approximately $1 billion ( 927 million). The purchase price is subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as provided in the Agreement.      The transfer of the Transferred Business is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, including receipt of necessary antitrust, financial and other regulatory approvals, the reorganization of the Transferred Business, including pension plans in the United Kingdom (as described below), the completion of the contribution or sale by AOAG of its assets and liabilities to a subsidiary, the transfer of GMAC UK plc's interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited to General Motors Financial Company, Inc. or an alternate entity designated by the Seller (unless either party elects to close without completion of the transfer), and the continued accuracy (subject to certain exceptions) at closing of certain of the Seller's representations and warranties. The transfer of the Opel/Vauxhall Business is expected to close by the end of 2017. The transfer of the Fincos will close as soon as practicable after the receipt of necessary antitrust, financial and other regulatory approvals, which may be after the transfer of the Opel/Vauxhall Business. The transfer of the Fincos will not occur unless the transfer of the Opel/Vauxhall Business occurs. There can be no assurance that all required governmental consents or clearances will be obtained or that the other closing conditions will be satisfied.      Issuance of the warrants is subject to approval by shareholders of the Purchaser holding at least two-thirds of the voting rights attributable to the Purchaser's ordinary shares at a meeting scheduled to be held on May 10, 2017. Holders of approximately 51.5% of the voting rights attributable to the Purchaser's ordinary shares have agreed with the Purchaser to vote their shares in favor of approval. In the event the Purchaser's shareholders do not approve issuance of the warrants, the Purchaser will instead pay the Seller approximately $0.7 billion ( 649 million), payable in five equal cash installments on each anniversary of the closing date.      The Seller and the Purchaser have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement, including, among others, covenants by the Seller to conduct the Transferred Business in the ordinary course between the execution of the Agreement and the consummation of the transaction.      The Seller has agreed to indemnify the Purchaser for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of covenants of the Seller in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities. Certain (but not all) of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to amount. Upon entry into the Agreement, the Company entered into a guarantee, dated as of March 5, 2017, for the benefit of the Purchaser and pursuant to which the Company has agreed to guarantee the Seller's indemnification obligations.      The Seller will retain net underfunded pension liabilities of approximately $6.5 billion primarily to current pensioners and former employees of the Transferred Business with vested pension rights. The Purchaser will assume approximately $2.8 billion ( 2.6 billion) of net underfunded pension liabilities primarily with respect to active employees of the Transferred Business, and at closing, the Seller will make payments to the Purchaser (or a pension funding vehicle) of approximately $3.2 billion ( 3.0 billion) in respect of these assumed liabilities, inclusive of the approximately $0.4 billion ( 400 million) de-risking premium payment described above. The pension liabilities described in this Current Report on Form 8-K are calculated as of December 31, 2016. The actual pension liabilities retained by the Seller and assumed by the Purchaser, as applicable, will be determined at the closing date and, as a result, may differ from the amounts reported herein.      The Seller will retain responsibility for the existing United Kingdom defined benefit pension plans related to the Transferred Business, including responsibility for service accruals through the closing date. Those plans with active participants are expected to close to future accrual as of the day before the closing date, subject to and without prejudice to, the legally required consultation procedures. Retention of these plans will be implemented by a reorganization of the relevant pension plans that will require the consent of the trustees of these plans. There can be no assurances regarding the employee consultation process, that the trustees' consent will be obtained, or that the trustees will not impose additional conditions to granting consent.      The Seller has agreed to provide certain transitional services to the Purchaser for a limited period of time following closing and not to engage in certain competing businesses in Europe for a period of three years.      The Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Seller and the Purchaser, including if certain closing conditions have not been satisfied on or before June 1, 2018. If the transfer of the Opel/Vauxhall Business is completed by such date, but the completion of the transfer of any of the Fincos has not been completed within 18 months after the closing of the transfer of the Opel/Vauxhall Business, the Seller will retain and liquidate the remaining Fincos.      The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017.

1181,MSFT,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a Form 8K - Regulation FD Disclosure - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on August 03, 2017.        Beginning July 1, 2017, Microsoft Corporation (the ""Company"") elected to early adopt the new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leases. The Company is furnishing this Form 8-K under Regulation FD to present the Company's previously reported financial information on a basis consistent with the standards. Beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2017, the Company's financial information will reflect adoption of the standards with prior periods adjusted accordingly.      Revenue from Contracts with Customers      In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. The Company elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2017 using the full retrospective method, which requires the Company to restate each prior reporting period presented consistent with the standard.      Adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Company's consolidated income statements and balances sheets, but had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on the consolidated cash flows statements. The most significant impact of the standard relates to the Company's accounting for software license revenue. Specifically, for Windows 10, the Company recognizes revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device. For certain multi-year, commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance, the Company recognizes license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period. Due to the complexity of certain commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard depends on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. Revenue recognition related to the Company's hardware, cloud offerings such as Office 365, LinkedIn, and professional services remains substantially unchanged.      Leases      In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases. The Company elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 2017 using a modified retrospective approach, which requires the Company to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company elected to apply the available practical expedients on adoption.      Adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, but did not have a material impact on the consolidated income statements and had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on the consolidated cash flows statements. The most significant impact of the standard is the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's accounting for capital leases remains substantially unchanged. Refer to Exhibit 99.1 for financial information on a basis consistent with the new standards for fiscal year 2017 and 2016.      The Company will host a conference call webcast at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time (4:30 p.m. Eastern time) on August 3, 2017 to discuss the new standards.

1205,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) filed a Form 8K - Director, Officer or Compensation Filing - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on November 16, 2017.        (i) 2018 Annual Bonus Plan      On November 16, 2017, upon the recommendation of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the ""Compensation Committee""), the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") approved the Company's 2018 Annual Bonus Plan effective for the performance period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018.      As part of the Company's overall compensation program, the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan provides an annual cash incentive opportunity for eligible salaried personnel (including the Company's named executive officers meeting the eligibility criteria) based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. The 2018 Annual Bonus Plan is substantially similar to the Company's 2017 Annual Bonus Plan and provides:      * for a single bonus pool (the ""Total Annual Bonus"") that will be based on the Company's performance measured against achievement of corporate-level performance metric goals for adjusted earnings per share and global sales on a constant currency basis (""Global sales"");      * the Total Annual Bonus as operated (i) will be capped at 90% of the aggregate annual bonus pool target (the ""Aggregate Annual Target"") in the event that the performance for Global sales is below 97% of the Company's approved performance goal for that metric; and (ii) will have a ceiling of 150% and a floor of 50% of the Aggregate Annual Target, with the Board having discretion to terminate, suspend or modify the plan and to reduce the Total Annual Bonus based on the Company's performance relative to its quality objectives and performance of its quality systems;      * the Total Annual Bonus will be allocated among corporate, global operations and each participating business, regional and country unit (each, a ""participating unit"") based on each participating unit's overall and relative performance measured against its achievement of that unit's predetermined ""Scorecard"" performance metrics and goals and taking into consideration, as appropriate, other factors; such allocation will be a percentage of the annual bonus pool target for each participating unit (representing the total target annual bonuses of all eligible employees for the year within that unit) (each such allocated amount, an ""Assigned Bonus Pool""); and      * the Assigned Bonus Pool for each participating unit will then be allocated among all managers of plan participants within that participating unit. Such managers will then evaluate the performance of the participants under their management and determine, for each participant, the percentage (between 0% and 150%) of the participant's target annual bonus that will be used to determine the participant's bonus award.      Awards to certain executive officers under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek reimbursement of a bonus award in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. The Company may also seek reimbursement of a bonus award if there is a restatement of the Company's financial results that would have reduced a previously granted bonus award's size or payment. The amount to be recouped would be the amount of any such reduction. Finally, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a bonus award, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the bonus award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan was established.

A copy of the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.      (ii) 2018 Performance Share Programs      On November 16, 2017, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the adoption of two performance share programs, the Boston Scientific Corporation 2018 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program (the ""2018 TSR PSP"") and the Boston Scientific Corporation 2018 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program (the ""2018 FCF PSP""). These programs are substantially similar to the performance share programs for 2017 and represent an important component of the overall mix of the Company's long-term incentive program. Under both programs, performance share awards      will be granted, if the relevant program criteria are met, to the Company's executive officers in the form of deferred stock units issued under the Company's 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was previously approved by the Company's stockholders. Awards to certain executive officers under both programs are subject to the Company's recoupment policy, which provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company may seek recovery of performance share units in the event of an executive officer's misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that results in a material violation of Company policy and causes significant harm to the Company. In addition, if the Company determines that it is required by law to apply a ""clawback"" or alternate recoupment provision to a performance share award, under the Dodd-Frank Act or otherwise, then such clawback or recoupment provision also will apply to the performance share award, as applicable, as if it had been included on the date the performance share award was granted.      (A) 2018 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program      The purpose of the 2018 TSR PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by comparing the Total Shareholder Return (""TSR"") of the Company's common stock to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020 (the ""Performance Period""). The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 200% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's TSR rank. Performance share awards will vest only upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria set forth in the 2018 TSR PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability.      This description of the 2018 TSR PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2018 TSR PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.      (B) 2018 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program      The purpose of the 2018 FCF PSP is to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce the concept of pay for performance by providing incentives for the achievement of key business performance objectives critical to its success. Under the 2018 FCF PSP, performance will be measured by comparing the Company's free cash flow for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018 against its 2018 financial plan performance for free cash flow. The number of performance shares awarded will be in a range of 0% to 150% of each participant's target number of awards based on the Company's free cash flow as compared to its financial plan. Performance share awards will only vest upon satisfaction of both the performance criteria and the payment eligibility criteria (which includes a three-year service period) set forth in the 2018 FCF PSP, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a change of control or termination for retirement, death or disability.      This description of the 2018 FCF PSP does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such program. A copy of the 2018 FCF PSP is included in this filing as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.

Amendment and Restatement of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan      At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the ""Meeting"") of Cisco Systems, Inc. (""Cisco"") held on December 11, 2017, Cisco's shareholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Cisco 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the ""Amended Stock Plan"").

As a result of such shareholder approval, the Amended Stock Plan was amended and modified to set a limit on the total value of equity and cash compensation that may be paid to a non-employee director during each fiscal year. Except for the addition of the limit on non-employee director compensation and providing that dividends and dividend equivalents will not be paid on unvested awards, the terms of the Amended Stock Plan remain unchanged.      A more complete description of the terms of the Amended Stock Plan and the material amendments and modifications thereto can be found in ""Compensation Committee Matters Proposal No. 2 Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan"" (pages 19 through 27) in Cisco's definitive proxy statement dated October 23, 2017, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2017 (the ""Proxy Statement""), which description is incorporated by reference herein.

Amendment and Restatement of the Executive Incentive Plan      At the Meeting held on December 11, 2017, Cisco's shareholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Cisco Executive Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the ""Amended EIP""). Under Section 162(m), shareholders must approve the material terms of the Cisco Executive Incentive Plan every five years. The amendment and restatement of the Cisco Executive Incentive Plan was approved by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of Cisco's Board of Directors on July 26, 2017, subject to the approval of Cisco's shareholders in accordance with Section 162(m). The Amended EIP will become available for performance periods beginning in fiscal 2019 with such shareholder approval on December 11, 2017.      The purpose of the Amended EIP is to motivate and reward eligible employees by making a portion of their cash compensation dependent on the achievement of certain objective performance goals related to the performance of Cisco and its affiliates. Previously, the Cisco Executive Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2012 annual meeting. As a result of the approval by shareholders at the Meeting, the Amended EIP is substantially the same as the version of the Cisco Executive Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2012 except that the Amended EIP provides that the maximum amount of any awards that can be paid under the Amended EIP to any participant during any fiscal year (instead of performance period) is $10,000,000, an annual limit on cash compensation that is prevalent among the companies within Cisco's peer group.
